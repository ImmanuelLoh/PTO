In 2023, the IRS issued a rule change allowing taxpayers to temporarily apply the regulations in effect prior to 2022 related to U.S. federal foreign tax credits as well as a separate rule change with interim guidance on the capitalization and amortization of R&D expenses. A cumulative one-time adjustment applicable to the prior period for these tax rule changes was recorded in 2023. Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.

The net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various annual limitations under the tax laws of the different jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2023, our Federal and California research and development credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $600 million and $6.3 billion, respectively. If not utilized, the Federal R&D credit will begin to expire in 2037 and the California R&D credit can be carried over indefinitely.

As of December 31, 2023, our investment tax credit carryforwards for state income tax purposes were approximately $1.0 billion and will begin to expire in 2029. We use the flow-through method of accounting for investment tax credits. We believe this tax credit is not likely to be realized. As of December 31, 2023, we maintained a valuation allowance with respect to California deferred tax assets, certain federal net operating losses, certain state net operating losses and tax credits, net deferred tax assets relating to Other Bet companies, and certain foreign net operating losses that we believe are not likely to be realized.

The tax years 2016 through 2022 remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Irish tax purposes. There are other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statements. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the effect, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions. We believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolutions occur. Although the timing of resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is not certain, it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits from certain U.S. federal, state, and non U.S. tax positions could decrease by approximately $700 million in the next 12 months.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Google was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google. We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure, platform services, and applications; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and devices. Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Use of Estimates Preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; contingent liabilities; fair values of financial instruments and goodwill; income taxes; inventory; and useful lives of property and equipment, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable, and the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Revenue Recognition Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, and the collectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or services is probable. Sales and other similar taxes are excluded from revenues. Advertising Revenues We generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on: \u2022 Google Search and other properties, including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play; \u2022 YouTube properties; and \u2022 Google Network properties, including revenues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Our customers generally purchase advertising inventory through Google Ads, Google Ad Manager, Google Display & Video 360, and Google Marketing Platform, among others. We offer advertising by delivering both performance and brand advertising. We recognize revenues for performance advertising when a user engages with the advertisement. For brand advertising, we recognize revenues when the ad is displayed, or a user views the ad. For ads placed on Google Network properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed on Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues, and amounts paid to Google Network partners",

Software Development Costs We expense software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, before technological feasibility is reached. Technological feasibility is typically reached shortly before the release of such products. As a result, development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented. Software development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and cloud-based applications used to deliver our services. We capitalize development costs related to these software applications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications were not material for the periods presented. Stock-based Compensation Stock-based compensation (SBC) primarily consists of Alphabet restricted stock units (RSUs). RSUs are equity classified and measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. We recognize RSU expense using the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur. RSUs are awarded dividend equivalents, which are subject to the same vesting conditions as the underlying award, and settled in Class C shares. For RSUs, shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory income tax withholding to be paid by us on behalf of our employees. As a result, fewer shares are issued than the number of RSUs outstanding, and the income tax withholding is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital. Additionally, SBC includes other stock-based awards, such as performance stock units (PSUs) that include market conditions and awards that may be settled in cash or the stock of certain Other Bet companies. PSUs and certain awards granted by Other Bet companies are equity classified and expense is recognized over the requisite service period. Certain awards granted by Other Bet companies are liability classified and remeasured at fair value through settlement. The fair value of awards granted by Other Bet companies is based on the equity valuation of the respective Other Bet company. Advertising and Promotional Expenses We expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $9.2 billion, $8.7 billion, and $8.7 billion, respectively. Performance Fees Performance fees refer to compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain investments.

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities. The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The determination of fair value involves the use of appropriate valuation methods and relevant inputs into valuation models. Our financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivative financial instruments, and certain non-marketable debt securities. Our financial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include non-marketable equity securities. Other financial assets and liabilities are carried at cost with fair value disclosed, if required. We measure certain other instruments, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, also at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Financial Instruments Our financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents, marketable and non-marketable securities, derivative financial instruments, accounts receivable, and convertible notes. Credit Risks We are subject to credit risk primarily from cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, derivative financial instruments, including foreign exchange contracts, accounts receivable, and convertible notes. We manage our credit risk exposure through timely assessment of our counterparty creditworthiness, credit limits, and use of collateral management. Foreign exchange contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the world. We manage our credit risk exposure by performing ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the amount of credit we extend. We generally do not require collateral from our customers. Cash Equivalents We invest excess cash primarily in asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, corporate debt securities, government bonds, money market funds, and time deposits. Marketable Securities We classify all marketable debt securities that have effective maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase as cash equivalents and those with effective maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. We have classified and accounted for our marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. After consideration of our risk versus reward objectives, as well as our liquidity requirements, we may sell these debt securities prior to their effective maturities. As we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify highly liquid securities with maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Revenue Backlog As of December 31, 2024, we had $93.2 billion of remaining performance obligations (\u201crevenue backlog\u201d), primarily related to Google Cloud. Revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months with the remainder to be recognized thereafter. The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts. Deferred Revenues We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2023 was $5.0 billion, of which $3.9 billion was recognized as revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2024 was $6.0 billion. Note 3. Financial Instruments 64.",

Fair Value Measurements Investments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable equity securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 1 and Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets or inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets. Debt securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine fair value. For certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in OI&E.

Investments Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment are classified within Level 3. Our valuation methods include option pricing models, market comparable approach, and common stock equivalent method, which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, expected time to exit, risk free rate, and the rights and obligations of the securities we hold. These inputs vary significantly based on investment type. As of December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $35.5 billion, of which $19.9 billion were remeasured at fair value during the year ended December 31, 2024, and were primarily classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy at the time of measurement.

The primary risk managed is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance investment returns. We recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the derivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at gross fair values. The accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation. Cash Flow Hedges We designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have maturities of 24 months or less. Cash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and subsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points and time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI. As of December 31, 2024, the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect was $731 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months. Fair Value Hedges We designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our marketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OI&E, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the related hedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in OI&E. Net Investment Hedges We designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in OI&E. Other Derivatives We enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to hedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of a subsidiary.

Under our stock plans, RSUs and other types of awards may be granted. Under the Alphabet 2021 Stock Plan, an RSU award is an agreement to issue shares of our Class C stock at the time the award vests. RSUs generally vest over four years contingent upon employment on the vesting date. RSUs are awarded dividend equivalents, which are subject to the same vesting conditions as the underlying award, and settled in Class C shares. As of December 31, 2024, there were 633 million shares of Class C stock reserved for future issuance under the Alphabet 2021 Stock Plan. Stock-Based Compensation For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, total SBC expense was $19.5 billion, $22.1 billion, and $22.8 billion, including amounts associated with awards we expect to settle in Alphabet stock of $18.8 billion, $21.7 billion, and $22.0 billion, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, we recognized tax benefits on total SBC expense, which are reflected in the provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income, of $3.9 billion, $4.5 billion, and $4.6 billion, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, tax benefit realized related to awards vested or exercised during the period was $4.7 billion, $5.6 billion, and $6.8 billion, respectively. These amounts do not include the indirect effects of stock-based awards, which primarily relate to the R&D tax credit. Stock-Based Award Activities The following table summarizes the activities for unvested Alphabet RSUs, which include dividend equivalents awarded to holders of unvested stock, for the year ended December 31, 2024 (in millions, except per share amounts): Weighted- Average Number of Grant-Date Shares Fair Value Unvested as of December 31, 2023 338 $ 104.93 Granted 195 $ 140.04 Vested (199) $ 110.89 Forfeited/canceled (35) $ 113.52 Unvested as of December 31, 2024 299 $ 122.77 The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023 was $127.22 and $97.59, respectively. Total fair value of RSUs, as of their respective vesting dates, during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, were $23.9 billion, $26.6 billion, and $33.3 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, there was $34.8 billion of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.5 years.

If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2025, foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2025 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2033. It is more likely than not that the majority of the net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized. The net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various annual limitations under the tax laws of the different jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2024, our Federal and California research and development credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $700 million and $6.4 billion, respectively. If not utilized, the Federal R&D credit will begin to expire in 2037 and the California R&D credit can be carried over indefinitely. We believe the majority of the federal tax credit and state tax credit is not likely to be realized. As of December 31, 2024, our investment tax credit carryforwards for state income tax purposes were approximately $1.2 billion and will begin to expire in 2030. We use the flow-through method of accounting for investment tax credits. We believe this tax credit is not likely to be realized. As of December 31, 2024, we maintained a valuation allowance with respect to California deferred tax assets, certain federal net operating losses, certain state net operating losses and tax credits, net deferred tax assets relating to Other Bet companies, and certain foreign net operating losses that we believe are not likely to be realized. We continue to reassess the remaining valuation allowance quarterly, and if future evidence allows for a partial or full release of the valuation allowance, a tax benefit will be recorded accordingly. Cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds, was $18.9 billion, $19.2 billion, and $27.4 billion as of December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively. 86.",

Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $7.1 billion, $9.4 billion, and $12.6 billion as of December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively, of which $5.3 billion, $7.4 billion, and $10.0 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, we accrued $622 million and $1.1 billion in interest and penalties in provision for income taxes, respectively. We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. Our two major tax jurisdictions are the U.S. federal and Ireland. We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. The IRS is currently examining our 2016 through 2021 tax returns. We have also received tax assessments in multiple foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or permanent establishment. We continue to defend such claims as presented. The tax years 2016 through 2023 remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Irish tax purposes. There are other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statements. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the effect, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions. We believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolutions occur. Although the timing of resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is not certain, we do not believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits from certain U.S. federal, state, and non U.S. tax positions will materially change in the next 12 months.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Google was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google. We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide customers with infrastructure and platform services and collaboration tools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV. Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Unaudited Interim Financial Information These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2022. We have made estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. These consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 filed with the SEC.

Revenue Backlog and Deferred Revenues As of March 31, 2022, we had $50.5 billion of remaining performance obligations (\u201crevenue backlog\u201d), primarily related to Google Cloud, and expect to recognize approximately half of this amount as revenues over the next 24 months with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenues. The amount and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by when our customers utilize services and our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms, which could affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when we expect to recognize such as revenues. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts. We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2021 was $3.8 billion, of which $1.4 billion was recognized as revenues during the three months ended March 31, 2022. Note 3. Financial Instruments Debt Securities We classify our marketable debt securities, which are accounted for as available-for-sale, within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy because we use quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine fair value. For certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in other income (expense), net. The fair value option was elected for these securities to align with the unrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts. Unrealized net losses related to debt securities still held where we have elected the fair value option were $35 million and $236 million as of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, the fair value of these debt securities was $4.7 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively.

Our share of gains and losses, including impairments, are included as a component of other income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 6 for further details on other income (expense), net. Derivative Financial Instruments We enter into derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk managed with derivative instruments is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance investment returns. We recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the derivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values where both the purchased and written options are with the same counterparty. For other derivative contracts, we present at gross fair values. We primarily record changes in the fair value in the Consolidated Statements of Income as either other income (expense), net, or revenues, or in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in AOCI, as discussed below. We enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. Further, we enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or pledged when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. Cash collateral received related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements are included in other current assets with a corresponding liability. Cash and non-cash collateral pledged related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements are included in other current assets. Cash Flow Hedges We designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other",

The initial value of the excluded component is amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument and recognized in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.

Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Total gross unrecognized tax benefits were $5.2 billion and $5.4 billion as of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, respectively. Total unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate were $3.7 billion and $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, respectively. For information regarding non-income taxes, see Note 9. Note 14. Information about Segments and Geographic Areas We report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets: \u2022 Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Google Maps, Google Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales of apps and in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and fees received for subscription- based products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV. \u2022 Google Cloud includes Google\u2019s infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues from fees received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace collaboration tools, and other enterprise services. \u2022 Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services. Revenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering activities, and hardware, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the integrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are managed centrally at a consolidated level. The associated costs, including depreciation and impairment, are allocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage or headcount. Unallocated corporate costs primarily include corporate initiatives, corporate shared costs, such as finance and legal, including certain fines and settlements, as well as costs associated with certain shared R&D activities. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are included in corporate costs. Our operating segments are not evaluated using asset information. The following table presents information about segments (in millions): Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 2022 Revenues: Google Services $ 51,178 $ 61,472 Google Cloud 4,047 5,821 Other Bets 198 440 Hedging gains (losses) (109) 278 Total revenues $ 55,314 $ 68,011 28",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Google was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google. We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products. Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Unaudited Interim Financial Information These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2023. We have made estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. These consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the SEC. Change in Accounting Estimate In January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and adjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain network equipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December 31, 2022, and those placed in service during the quarter ended March 31, 2023, the effect of this change in estimate was a reduction in depreciation expense of $988 million and an increase in net income of $770 million, or $0.06 per basic and $0.06 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Stock Split Effected in the Form of a Stock Dividend (\u201cStock Split\u201d) On July 15, 2022, we executed a 20-for-one stock split of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. All prior period references made to share or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and applicable disclosures prior to the effective date have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split. Prior Period Reclassifications Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation. 10",

Revenue Backlog As of March 31, 2023, we had $61.7 billion of remaining performance obligations (\u201crevenue backlog\u201d), primarily related to Google Cloud. Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenue. The amount and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services, which could affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when we expect to recognize such as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts. Deferred Revenues We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2022 was $4.5 billion, of which $1.6 billion was recognized as revenues during the three months ended March 31, 2023. 11",

Financial Instruments Fair Value Measurements Investments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable equity securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 1 and Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets or inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets. Debt securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine fair value. For certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in other income (expense), net.

The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the value based on valuation methods which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. The fair value of non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment are classified within Level 3. As of March 31, 2023 the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $29.1 billion, of which $10.7 billion were re-measured at fair value during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and primarily classified as Level 2 investments. 13",

        "text": "Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. Derivative Financial Instruments We use derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk managed is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance investment returns. We recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the derivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at gross fair values. The accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation. Cash Flow Hedges We designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have maturities of 24 months or less. Cash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and subsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points and time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI. As of March 31, 2023 the net accumulated loss on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect was $55 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months. Fair Value Hedges We designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our marketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the related hedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in other income (expense), net. Net Investment Hedges We designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in other income (expense), net.

As part of this program, in January 2023 we announced a reduction of our workforce, and as a result in the first quarter of 2023 we recorded employee severance and related charges of $2.0 billion, representing the majority of expected costs associated with this action. In addition, we are taking actions to optimize our global office space, and as a result, we recorded charges related to office space reductions of $564 million in the first quarter of 2023.

Indemnifications In the normal course of business, including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate activities, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network partners, distribution partners, customers of Google Cloud offerings, lessors, and service providers with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to defend and/or hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents. It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. As of March 31, 2023, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible. 24",

Note 14. Information about Segments and Geographic Areas We report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets: \u2022 Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Google Maps, Google Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales of apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV. \u2022 Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues from fees received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services. \u2022 Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services. Revenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering activities, and hardware, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the integrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are managed centrally at a consolidated level.

The effect of this change was a reduction in depreciation expense of $988 million for the first quarter of 2023, recognized primarily in cost of revenues and R&D expenses. For additional information, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. \u2022 Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, our segment reporting reflects two changes: (i) DeepMind, previously reported within Other Bets, is reported as part of Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs, and (ii) we updated and simplified our cost allocation methodologies to provide our business leaders with increased transparency for decision-making. Prior periods have been recast to conform to the current presentation. For additional information, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. \u2022 Beginning in 2023, the timing of our annual employee stock-based compensation awards shifted from January to March. While the shift in timing itself will not affect the amount of stock-based compensation expense over the full fiscal year 2023, it results in relatively less expense recognized in the first quarter compared to the remaining quarters of the year. \u2022 Repurchases of Class A and Class C shares were $15.1 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. \u2022 Operating cash flow was $23.5 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023. \u2022 Capital expenditures, which primarily reflected investments in technical infrastructure, were $6.3 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023. \u2022 As of March 31, 2023, we had 190,711 employees, which includes almost all of the employees affected by the reduction of our workforce.

Share Repurchase Program In April 2022, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares. As of March 31, 2023, $13.1 billion remains available for Class A and Class C share repurchases. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we repurchased and subsequently retired 157 million shares for $15.1 billion. Of the aggregate amount repurchased and subsequently retired, 21 million shares were Class A stock for $2.0 billion and 136 million shares were Class C stock for $13.1 billion. In April 2023, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was enacted on August 16, 2022 and requires a one percent excise tax on certain share repurchases in excess of shares issued for employee compensation made after December 31, 2022. We do not expect this provision to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. European Commission Fines In 2017, 2018 and 2019, the EC announced decisions that certain actions taken by Google infringed European competition law and imposed fines of \u20ac2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017), \u20ac4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018), and \u20ac1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019), respectively. On September 14, 2022, the General Court reduced the 2018 fine from \u20ac4.3 billion to \u20ac4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal to the European Court of Justice. While each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines.

Revenue Backlog As of March 31, 2024, we had $72.5 billion of remaining performance obligations (\u201crevenue backlog\u201d), primarily related to Google Cloud. Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenue. The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts. Deferred Revenues We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2023 was $5.0 billion, of which $2.4 billion was recognized as revenues during the three months ended March 31, 2024. Note 3.

Investments Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment are classified within Level 3. Our valuation methods include option pricing models, market comparable approach, and common stock equivalent method, which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, expected time to exit, risk free rate, and the rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. These inputs significantly vary based on investment type. As of March 31, 2024, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $31.4 billion, of which $13.6 billion were remeasured at fair value during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and primarily classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy at the time of measurement. 13",

        "text": "Derivative Financial Instruments We use derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk managed is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance investment returns. We recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the derivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at gross fair values. The accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation. Cash Flow Hedges We designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States (U.S.) dollar. These contracts have maturities of 24 months or less. Cash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and subsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points and time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI. As of March 31, 2024, the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect was $128 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months. Fair Value Hedges We designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our marketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OI&E, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the related hedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in OI&E. Net Investment Hedges We designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in OI&E. Other Derivatives We enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to hedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting hedges are primarily recorded in OI&E along with the foreign",

The results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements. For certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us, and their creditors do not have recourse to us. As of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $4.9 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs were $2.5 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs that are included within Other Bets. Total noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were $3.4 billion and $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively, of which $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion is redeemable noncontrolling interest (RNCI) as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was not material for any period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of OI&E. See Note 6 for further details on OI&E. Unconsolidated VIEs We have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private companies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve power generation using renewable sources. We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We account for these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments. The maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the investments and any future funding commitments. The maximum exposure and carrying value of these unconsolidated VIEs were $5.7 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2023 and $6.9 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively, as of March 31, 2024.

The notes in the table above are fixed-rate senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with each other. We may redeem the notes at any time in whole or in part at specified redemption prices. The effective interest rates are based on proceeds received with interest payable semi-annually. The total estimated fair value of the outstanding notes was approximately $10.3 billion and $9.0 billion as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively. The fair value was determined based on observable market prices of identical instruments in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

Note 13. Information about Segments and Geographic Areas We report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets: \u2022 Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Google Maps, Google Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; fees received for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One; the sale of apps and in-app purchases and devices. \u2022 Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from consumption-based fees and subscriptions received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services. \u2022 Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services. Revenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering activities, and devices, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the integrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are managed centrally at a consolidated level. These costs, including the associated depreciation and impairment, are allocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage, headcount, or revenue. Certain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs primarily include AI-focused shared R&D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; corporate initiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and legal costs, including certain fines",

For additional information, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Dividend Program On April 25, 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet declared a cash dividend of $0.20 per share to be paid on June 17, 2024, to stockholders of record as of June 10, 2024, on each of the company\u2019s Class A, Class B, and Class C shares. The company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future, subject to review and approval by the company\u2019s Board of Directors in its sole discretion.

European Commission Fines In 2017, 2018 and 2019, the EC announced decisions that certain actions taken by Google infringed European competition law and imposed fines of \u20ac2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017), \u20ac4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018), and \u20ac1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019), respectively. On September 14, 2022, the General Court reduced the 2018 fine from \u20ac4.3 billion to \u20ac4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal to the European Court of Justice. While each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines. For additional information, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Taxes As of March 31, 2024, we had income taxes payable of $4.2 billion, of which $2.1 billion was short-term, related to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\"). As permitted by the Tax Act, we will pay the transition tax in annual interest-free installments through 2025. We also have long-term taxes payable of $7.1 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of March 31, 2024. Purchase Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations As of March 31, 2024, we had material purchase commitments and other contractual obligations of $44.0 billion, of which $29.4 billion was short-term. These amounts primarily consist of purchase orders for certain technical infrastructure as well as the non-cancelable portion or the minimum cancellation fee in certain agreements related to commitments to purchase licenses, including content licenses, inventory and network capacity. For those agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation",

Revenue Backlog As of March 31, 2025, we had $92.4 billion of remaining performance obligations (\u201crevenue backlog\u201d), primarily related to Google Cloud. Revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately 55% of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months with the remainder to be recognized thereafter. The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts. Deferred Revenues We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2024 was $6.0 billion, of which $2.6 billion was recognized as revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2025. Total deferred revenue as of March 31, 2025 was $6.6 billion. Note 3.

Investments Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment are classified within Level 3. Our valuation methods include option pricing models, market comparable approach, and common stock equivalent method, which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, expected time to exit, risk free rate, and the rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. These inputs vary significantly based on investment type. As of March 31, 2025, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $48.6 billion, of which $25.0 billion were remeasured at fair value during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and were primarily classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy at the time of measurement. 13",

During the three months ended March 31, 2025, we converted $3.0 billion of our convertible notes into equity securities, which included gains from conversion of $416 million. These gains were recognized in OI&E within the Consolidated Statement of Income. See Note 7 for further details on OI&E. Derivative Financial Instruments We use derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk managed is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance investment returns. We recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the derivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at gross fair values. The accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation. Cash Flow Hedges We designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States (U.S.) dollar. These contracts have maturities of 24 months or less. Cash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and subsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points and time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI. As of March 31, 2025, the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect was $151 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months. Fair Value Hedges We designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our marketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OI&E, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the related hedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in OI&E. Net Investment Hedges We designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude forward points",

The results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements. For certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us, and their creditors do not have recourse to us. As of December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $8.7 billion and $7.8 billion, respectively, and are primarily included in cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs were $2.3 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs that are included within Other Bets. As of December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, total noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were $4.2 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively, of which $1.1 billion was redeemable noncontrolling interests (RNCI) in each period. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was not material for any period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of OI&E. See Note 7 for further details on OI&E. Unconsolidated VIEs We have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private companies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve power generation using renewable sources. We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We account for these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments, which are included within non-marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the investments and any future funding commitments. As of December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, our future funding commitments related to unconsolidated VIE investments were $1.5 billion in each period. Note 6. Debt Short-Term Debt We have a short-term debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion of commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, respectively, with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 4.4% in each period. The estimated fair value of the commercial paper approximated its carrying value as of March 31, 2025. Our short-term debt balance also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt. 21",

The total estimated fair value of the outstanding notes was approximately $9.0 billion and $9.1 billion as of December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, respectively. The fair value was determined based on observable market prices of identical instruments in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit Facility As of March 31, 2025, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, of which $4.0 billion expires in April 2025 and $6.0 billion expires in April 2028. In April 2025, we entered into a new $4.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring in April 2026. Additionally, in April 2025 we terminated the $6.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring in April 2028 and entered into a new $6.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring in April 2030.

Commitments and Contingencies Commitments We have content licensing agreements with future fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments of $8.6 billion as of March 31, 2025, of which the majority is paid quarterly through the first quarter of 2030. Indemnifications In the normal course of business, including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate activities, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network partners, distribution partners, customers of Google Cloud offerings, lessors, and service providers with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to defend and/or indemnify certain parties against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents. It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. As of March 31, 2025, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible. Legal Matters We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate. Certain outstanding matters seek speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts, substantial changes to our business practices and products, or structural remedies. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and we may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of outstanding legal matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect. We expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred. Antitrust Matters We are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations as well as litigation on various competition matters by regulatory authorities and private parties in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally, including the following: \u2022 Shopping: In June 2017, the EC announced",

Immaterial differences in net income per share across our Class A, Class B, and Class C shares may arise due to the allocation of distributed earnings, which is based on the holders as of the record date, compared with the allocation of undistributed earnings and number of shares, which is based on the weighted average shares outstanding over the periods. 29",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Google was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google. We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide customers with infrastructure and platform services and collaboration tools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV. Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Unaudited Interim Financial Information These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2022. We have made estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. These consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 filed with the SEC. Stock Split Effected in the Form of a Stock Dividend (\u201cStock Split\u201d) On February 1, 2022, the company announced that the Board of Directors had approved and declared a 20- for-one stock split in the form of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the company\u2019s Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. The Stock Split had a record date of July 1, 2022 and an effective date of July 15, 2022. The par value per share of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock remains unchanged at $0.001 per share after the Stock Split. All references made to share or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and applicable disclosures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split.

Our share of gains and losses, including impairments, are included as a component of other income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 6 for further details on other income (expense), net. Derivative Financial Instruments We enter into derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk managed with derivative instruments is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance investment returns. We recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the derivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values where both the purchased and written options are with the same counterparty. For other derivative contracts, we present at gross fair values. We primarily record changes in the fair value in the Consolidated Statements of Income as either other income (expense), net, or revenues, or in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in AOCI, as discussed below. We enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. Further, we enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or pledged when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. Cash collateral received related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements are included in other current assets with a corresponding liability. Cash and non-cash collateral pledged related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements are included in other current assets.

The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.

As of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2022, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $6.0 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs were $2.5 billion for both periods. As of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2022, total noncontrolling interests (NCI), including redeemable noncontrolling interests (RNCI), in our consolidated subsidiaries was $4.3 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was not material for any period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of other income (expense), net. See Note 6 for further details on other income (expense), net. Unconsolidated VIEs We have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private companies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve power generation using renewable sources. We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We account for these investments as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments. The maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the investments and any future funding commitments. We have determined that the single source of our exposure to these VIEs is our capital investments in them. The carrying value and maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs were $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2021 and $2.4 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2022. Note 5. Debt Short-Term Debt We have a debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2022. Our short-term debt balance also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt. Long-Term Debt Total outstanding debt is summarized below (in millions, except percentages): As of Effective Interest December 31, As of Maturity Coupon Rate Rate 2021 June 30, 2022 Debt 2014-2020 Notes Issuances 2024 - 2060 0.45% - 3.38% 0.57% - 3.38% $ 13,000 $ 13,000 Future finance lease payments, net and other (1) 2,086 1,966 Total debt 15,086 14,966 Unamortized discount and debt issuance costs (156) (150) Less: Current portion future finance lease payments,",

Contingencies Indemnifications In the normal course of business, including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate activities, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network partners, customers of Google Cloud offerings, lessors, and service providers with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents. It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, we have a limited history of prior indemnification claims and the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. As of June 30, 2022, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible. Legal Matters Antitrust Investigations On November 30, 2010, the EC's Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various antitrust-related complaints against us. On June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display and ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a \u20ac2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision to the General Court, and on September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes",

Information about Segments and Geographic Areas We report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets: \u2022 Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Google Maps, Google Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales of apps and in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and fees received for subscription- based products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV. \u2022 Google Cloud includes Google\u2019s infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues from fees received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace collaboration tools, and other enterprise services. \u2022 Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services. Revenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering activities, and hardware, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the integrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are managed centrally at a consolidated level. The associated costs, including depreciation and impairment, are allocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage or headcount. Unallocated corporate costs primarily include corporate initiatives, corporate shared costs, such as finance and legal, including certain fines and settlements, as well as costs associated with certain shared R&D activities. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are included in corporate costs. Our operating segments are not evaluated using asset information. The following table presents information about our segments (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2021 2022 2021 2022 Revenues: Google Services $ 57,067 $ 62,841 $ 108,245 $ 124,313 Google Cloud 4,628 6,276 8,675 12,097 Other Bets 192 193 390 633 Hedging gains (losses) (7) 375 (116) 653 Total revenues $ 61,880 $ 69,685 $ 117,194 $ 137,696 31",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Google was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google. We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products. Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Unaudited Interim Financial Information These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2023. We have made estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. These consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the SEC. Change in Accounting Estimate In January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and adjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain network equipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December 31, 2022, and those placed in service during the six months ended June 30, 2023, the effect of this change in estimate was a reduction in depreciation expense of $966 million and $2.0 billion and an increase in net income of $752 million and $1.5 billion, or $0.06 and $0.12 per basic and $0.06 and $0.12 per diluted share, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively.

Revenue Backlog As of June 30, 2023, we had $60.6 billion of remaining performance obligations (\u201crevenue backlog\u201d), primarily related to Google Cloud. Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenue. The amount and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services, which could affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when we expect to recognize such as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts. Deferred Revenues We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2022 was $4.5 billion, of which $2.1 billion was recognized as revenues during the six months ended June 30, 2023. 12",

Financial Instruments Fair Value Measurements Investments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable equity securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 1 and Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets or inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets. Debt securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine fair value.

The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the value based on valuation methods which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. The fair value of non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment are classified within Level 3. As of June 30, 2023 the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $29.1 billion, of which $1.5 billion were remeasured at fair value during the three months ended June 30, 2023 and primarily classified as Level 3. 14",

Equity Securities Accounted for Under the Equity Method As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023 equity securities accounted for under the equity method had a carrying value of approximately $1.5 billion for both periods. Our share of gains and losses, including impairments, are included as a component of other income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 6 for further details on other income (expense), net. Derivative Financial Instruments We use derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk managed is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance investment returns. We recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the derivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at gross fair values. The accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation. Cash Flow Hedges We designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have maturities of 24 months or less. Cash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and subsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points and time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI. As of June 30, 2023 the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect was $24 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months. Fair Value Hedges We designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our marketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the related hedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in other income (expense), net. Net Investment Hedges We designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment.",

Commitments and Contingencies Commitments We have content licensing agreements with future fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments of $11.5 billion as of June 30, 2023, of which the majority is paid over seven years ending in the first quarter of 2030. Indemnifications In the normal course of business, including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate activities, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network partners, distribution partners, customers of Google Cloud offerings, lessors, and service providers with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to defend and/or hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents. It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. As of June 30, 2023, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible. 26",

Certain of these arrangements result in a portion of the cash received from and paid to the contract manufacturers to be presented as financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Share Repurchase Program During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, we repurchased and subsequently retired 131 million and 288 million shares for $15.1 billion and $30.2 billion, respectively. Of the aggregate amount repurchased and subsequently retired during the three months ended June 30, 2023, 17 million shares were Class A stock for $1.9 billion and 114 million shares were Class C stock for $13.2 billion. Of the aggregate amount repurchased and subsequently retired during the six months ended June 30, 2023, 37 million shares were Class A stock for $3.9 billion and 251 million shares were Class C stock for $26.3 billion. In April 2022, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares. The repurchases from the April 2022 authorization were completed during the second quarter of 2023. In April 2023, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares. As of June 30, 2023, $68.1 billion remains available for Class A and Class C share repurchases.

The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was enacted on August 16, 2022 and requires a one percent excise tax on certain share repurchases in excess of shares issued for employee compensation made after December 31, 2022. We do not expect this provision to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. European Commission Fines In 2017, 2018 and 2019, the EC announced decisions that certain actions taken by Google infringed European competition law and imposed fines of \u20ac2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017), \u20ac4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018), and \u20ac1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019), respectively. On September 14, 2022, the General Court reduced the 2018 fine from \u20ac4.3 billion to \u20ac4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal to the European Court of Justice. While each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines.

Revenue Backlog As of June 30, 2024, we had $78.8 billion of remaining performance obligations (\u201crevenue backlog\u201d), primarily related to Google Cloud. Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenue. The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts. Deferred Revenues We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2023 was $5.0 billion, of which $2.9 billion was recognized as revenues during the six months ended June 30, 2024. Note 3.

Investments Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment are classified within Level 3. Our valuation methods include option pricing models, market comparable approach, and common stock equivalent method, which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, expected time to exit, risk free rate, and the rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. These inputs significantly vary based on investment type. As of June 30, 2024, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $31.6 billion, of which $2.2 billion were remeasured at fair value during the three months ended June 30, 2024 and classified within Level 2 and Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy at the time of measurement. 14",

The fair value was determined based on observable market prices of identical instruments in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

Revenue Backlog As of June 30, 2025, we had $108.2 billion of remaining performance obligations (\u201crevenue backlog\u201d), primarily related to Google Cloud. Revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately 55% of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months with the remainder to be recognized thereafter. The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts. Deferred Revenues We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2024 was $6.0 billion, of which $3.5 billion was recognized as revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2025. Total deferred revenue as of June 30, 2025 was $6.8 billion. Note 3.

Investments Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment are classified within Level 3. Our valuation methods include option pricing models, market comparable approach, and common stock equivalent method, which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, expected time to exit, risk free rate, and the rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. These inputs vary significantly based on investment type. As of June 30, 2025, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $49.8 billion, of which $3.2 billion was remeasured at fair value during the three months ended June 30, 2025 and was primarily classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy at the time of measurement. 15",

During the six months ended June 30, 2025, we converted $3.0 billion of our convertible notes into equity securities, which included gains from conversion of $416 million. These gains were recognized in OI&E within the Consolidated Statement of Income. See Note 7 for further details on OI&E. Derivative Financial Instruments We use derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk managed is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance investment returns. We recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the derivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at gross fair values. The accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation. Cash Flow Hedges We designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States (U.S.) dollar. These contracts have maturities of 24 months or less. Cash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and subsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points and time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI. As of June 30, 2025, the net accumulated loss on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect was $767 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months. Fair Value Hedges We designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our marketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OI&E, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the related hedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in OI&E. Net Investment Hedges We designate foreign currency forward contracts, option contracts (including collars), and foreign currency- denominated debt as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to our investment in foreign subsidiaries.

The results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements. For certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us, and their creditors do not have recourse to us. As of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $8.7 billion and $7.0 billion, respectively, and are primarily included in cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025, liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs were $2.3 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs that are included within Other Bets. As of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025, total noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were $4.2 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, of which $1.1 billion was redeemable noncontrolling interests (RNCI) in each period. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was not material for any period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of OI&E. See Note 7 for further details on OI&E. Unconsolidated VIEs We have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private companies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve power generation using renewable sources. We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We account for these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments, which are included within non-marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the investments and any future funding commitments. As of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025, our future funding commitments related to unconsolidated VIE investments were $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. Note 6. Debt Short-Term Debt We have a short-term debt financing program of up to $25.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had $2.3 billion and $3.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025, respectively, with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 4.4% in each period. The estimated fair value of the commercial paper approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025. Our short-term debt balance also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt. Long-Term Debt In May 2025, we issued $5.0 billion of U.S. dollar-denominated fixed-rate senior unsecured notes in four",

The total estimated fair value of the outstanding notes was approximately $9.0 billion and $21.9 billion as of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025, respectively. The fair value was determined based on observable market prices of identical instruments in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

Commitments and Contingencies Commitments We have content licensing agreements with future fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments of $8.2 billion as of June 30, 2025, of which the majority is paid quarterly through the first quarter of 2030. Indemnifications In the normal course of business, including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate activities, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network partners, distribution partners, customers of Google Cloud offerings, lessors, and service providers with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to defend and/or indemnify certain parties against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents. It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. As of June 30, 2025, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible. Legal Matters We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate. Certain outstanding matters seek speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts, substantial changes to our business practices and products, or structural remedies. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and we may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of outstanding legal matters are inherently unpredictable and",

Income Taxes The following table presents provision for income taxes (in millions, except for effective tax rate): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2024 2025 2024 2025 Income before provision for income taxes $ 27,551 $ 33,933 $ 55,866 $ 75,722 Provision for income taxes $ 3,932 $ 5,737 $ 8,585 $ 12,986 Effective tax rate 14.3 % 16.9 % 15.4 % 17.1 % We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $12.6 billion and $12.9 billion, of which $10.0 billion and $11.0 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate, as of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025, respectively. On July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) was signed into law. This legislation includes changes to U.S. federal tax law, which may be subject to further clarification and the issuance of interpretive guidance. We are assessing the legislation and its effect on our consolidated financial statements, which we expect to begin reflecting in the three month period ended September 30, 2025. Note 15.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Google was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google. We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide customers with infrastructure and platform services and collaboration tools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV. Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Unaudited Interim Financial Information These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2022. We have made estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. These consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 filed with the SEC. Stock Split Effected in the Form of a Stock Dividend (\u201cStock Split\u201d) On February 1, 2022, the company announced that the Board of Directors had approved and declared a 20- for-one stock split in the form of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the company\u2019s Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. The Stock Split had a record date of July 1, 2022 and an effective date of July 15, 2022. The par value per share of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock remains unchanged at $0.001 per share after the Stock Split. All prior period references made to share or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and applicable disclosures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split. 11",

Revenue Backlog and Deferred Revenues As of September 30, 2022, we had $52.4 billion of remaining performance obligations (\u201crevenue backlog\u201d), primarily related to Google Cloud, and expect to recognize approximately half of this amount as revenues over the next 24 months with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenues. The amount and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by when our customers utilize services and our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms, which could affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when we expect to recognize such as revenues. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts. We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2021 was $3.8 billion, of which $2.4 billion was recognized as revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Note 3. Financial Instruments Debt Securities We classify our marketable debt securities, which are accounted for as available-for-sale, within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy because we use quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine fair value. 12",

We primarily record changes in the fair value in the Consolidated Statements of Income as either other income (expense), net, or revenues, or in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in AOCI, as discussed below. We enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. Further, we enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or pledged when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. Cash collateral received related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements are included in other current assets with a corresponding liability. Cash and non-cash collateral pledged related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements are included in other current assets. Cash Flow Hedges We designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have maturities of 24 months or less. Cash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and subsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude the change in forward points and time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness. The initial value of the excluded component is amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument and recognized in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI. If the hedged transactions become probable of not occurring, the corresponding amounts in AOCI are reclassified to other income (expense), net in the period of de-designation. As of September 30, 2022, the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect was $1.9 billion, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings within the next 12 months. Fair Value Hedges We designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the related hedged items. We exclude changes in forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in other income (expense), net. Net Investment Hedges We designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment.

The results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements. For certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us and their creditors do not have recourse to us. As of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $6.0 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs were $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, total noncontrolling interests (NCI), including redeemable noncontrolling interests (RNCI), in our consolidated subsidiaries were $4.3 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was not material for any period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of other income (expense), net. See Note 6 for further details on other income (expense), net. Unconsolidated VIEs We have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private companies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve power generation using renewable sources. We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We account for these investments as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments. The maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the investments and any future funding commitments. We have determined that the single source of our exposure to these VIEs is our capital investments in them. The carrying value and maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs were $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2021 and $2.6 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, as of September 30, 2022.

Information about Segments and Geographic Areas We report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets: \u2022 Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Google Maps, Google Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales of apps and in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and fees received for subscription- based products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV. \u2022 Google Cloud includes Google\u2019s infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues from fees received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace collaboration tools, and other enterprise services. \u2022 Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services. Revenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering activities, and hardware, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the integrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are managed centrally at a consolidated level. The associated costs, including depreciation and impairment, are allocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage or headcount. Unallocated corporate costs primarily include corporate initiatives, corporate shared costs, such as finance and legal, including certain fines and settlements, as well as costs associated with certain shared R&D activities. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are included in corporate costs. Our operating segments are not evaluated using asset information.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Google was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google. We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products. Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Unaudited Interim Financial Information These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2023. We have made estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. These consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the SEC. Change in Accounting Estimate In January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and adjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain network equipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December 31, 2022, and those placed in service during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the effect of this change in estimate was a reduction in depreciation expense of $977 million and $2.9 billion and an increase in net income of $761 million and $2.3 billion, or $0.06 and $0.18 per basic and $0.06 and $0.18 per diluted share, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

Revenue Backlog As of September 30, 2023, we had $64.9 billion of remaining performance obligations (\u201crevenue backlog\u201d), primarily related to Google Cloud. Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenue. The amount and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services, which could affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when we expect to recognize such as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts. Deferred Revenues We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2022 was $4.5 billion, of which $2.3 billion was recognized as revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 12",

Financial Instruments Fair Value Measurements Investments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable equity securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 1 and Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets or inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets. Debt securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine fair value. For certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in other income (expense), net. The fair value option was elected for these securities to align with the unrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts.

The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the value based on valuation methods which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. The fair value of non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment are classified within Level 3. As of September 30, 2023, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $28.8 billion, of which $10.4 billion were remeasured at fair value during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and primarily classified as Level 2. 14",

Equity Securities Accounted for Under the Equity Method As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023, equity securities accounted for under the equity method had a carrying value of approximately $1.5 billion for both periods. Our share of gains and losses, including impairments, are included as a component of OI&E, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 6 for further details on OI&E. Derivative Financial Instruments We use derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk managed is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance investment returns. We recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the derivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at gross fair values. The accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation. Cash Flow Hedges We designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have maturities of 24 months or less. Cash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and subsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points and time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI. As of September 30, 2023, the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect was $691 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months. Fair Value Hedges We designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our marketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OI&E, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the related hedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in OI&E. Net Investment Hedges We designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize",

Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting hedges are primarily recorded in OI&E along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities. We also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates, commodity prices, credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns. From time to time, we enter into derivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities.

Note 7. Workforce Reduction and Other Initiatives We have a company-wide effort underway to re-engineer our cost base. As part of this program, in January 2023, we announced a reduction of our workforce. As a result, total employee severance and related charges recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were $86 million and $2.1 billion, respectively. Substantially all of the employees affected were no longer included in our headcount as of September 30, 2023. In addition, we are taking actions to optimize our global office space. As a result, exit charges recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, were $16 million and $649 million, respectively, as reflected in the table below. In addition to these exit charges, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred $207 million in accelerated rent and accelerated depreciation, which are not included in the table below. We may incur additional charges in the future as we further evaluate our real estate needs. 24",

Indemnifications In the normal course of business, including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate activities, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network partners, distribution partners, customers of Google Cloud offerings, lessors, and service providers with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to defend and/or hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents. It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. As of September 30, 2023, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible. 26",

For additional information, see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. \u2022 In January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment, resulting in a change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment to six years. The effect of this change was a reduction in depreciation expense of $977 million and $2.9 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, recognized primarily in cost of revenues and R&D expenses. For additional information, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. \u2022 On July 21, 2023, the IRS announced a rule change allowing taxpayers to temporarily apply the regulations in effect prior to 2022 related to U.S. federal foreign tax credits. This announcement only applies to foreign taxes paid or accrued in the fiscal years 2022 and 2023. A cumulative one-time adjustment applicable to prior periods for this tax rule change was recorded in the third quarter of 2023 and resulted in our effective tax rate of 7.1% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 and 13.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. \u2022 Repurchases of Class A and Class C shares were $15.9 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. \u2022 Operating cash flow was $30.7 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which reflects the 2023 IRS payment deferral relief made available to taxpayers headquartered in designated counties in California. On October 16, 2023, we made an estimated income tax payment to the IRS of $10.5 billion that will be reflected in our fourth quarter operating cash flow. \u2022 Capital expenditures, which primarily reflected investments in technical infrastructure, were $8.1 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. \u2022 As of September 30, 2023, we had 182,381 employees.

As of September 30, 2023, the amount of total future lease payments under operating leases, which had a weighted average remaining lease term of 8.2 years, was $17.9 billion. As of September 30, 2023, we have entered into leases that have not yet commenced with future lease payments of $3.5 billion, that are not yet recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These leases will commence between 2023 and 2026 with non-cancelable lease terms of 1 to 25 years. As of September 30, 2023, our actions to optimize our office space did not affect our operating lease obligations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2023, our operating lease expenses (including variable lease costs) were $2.7 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. Finance lease costs were not material for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2023. Financing We have a short-term debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2023, we had no commercial paper outstanding. As of September 30, 2023, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, $4.0 billion expiring in April 2024 and $6.0 billion expiring in April 2028. The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using certain market rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals. No amounts have been borrowed under the credit facilities. As of September 30, 2023, we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with a total carrying value of $12.9 billion. See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information on our debt. We primarily utilize contract manufacturers for the assembly of our servers used in our technical infrastructure and hardware products we sell. We have agreements where we may purchase components directly from suppliers and then supply these components to contract manufacturers for use in the assembly of the servers and hardware products. Certain of these arrangements result in a portion of the cash received from and paid to the contract manufacturers to be presented as financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

In April 2023, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares. As of September 30, 2023, $52.3 billion remains available for Class A and Class C share repurchases. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was enacted on August 16, 2022 and requires a one percent excise tax on certain share repurchases in excess of shares issued for employee compensation made after December 31, 2022. We do not expect this provision to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. European Commission Fines In 2017, 2018 and 2019, the EC announced decisions that certain actions taken by Google infringed European competition law and imposed fines of \u20ac2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017), \u20ac4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018), and \u20ac1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019), respectively. On September 14, 2022, the General Court reduced the 2018 fine from \u20ac4.3 billion to \u20ac4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal to the European Court of Justice. While each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines.

Revenue Backlog As of September 30, 2024, we had $86.8 billion of remaining performance obligations (\u201crevenue backlog\u201d), primarily related to Google Cloud. Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenue. The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months with the remainder to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts. Deferred Revenues We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2023 was $5.0 billion, of which $3.4 billion was recognized as revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Note 3.

Investments Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment are classified within Level 3. Our valuation methods include option pricing models, market comparable approach, and common stock equivalent method, which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, expected time to exit, risk free rate, and the rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. These inputs significantly vary based on investment type. As of September 30, 2024, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $33.7 billion, of which $13.7 billion were remeasured at fair value during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and were primarily classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy at the time of measurement. 14",

Equity Securities Accounted for Under the Equity Method As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, equity securities accounted for under the equity method had a carrying value of approximately $1.7 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. Our share of gains and losses, including impairments, are included as a component of OI&E, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 6 for further details on OI&E. Certain of our equity method securities include our investments in VIEs where we are not the primary beneficiary. See Note 4 for further details on VIEs. Convertible Notes As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, we had investments in convertible notes of $921 million and $2.8 billion, respectively, majority of which are convertible notes held for investment. Our convertible notes held for investment are recorded at amortized cost which includes unpaid principal balances, deferred origination costs, and any related discount or premium, net of allowances for credit losses, and are included within other non-current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Derivative Financial Instruments We use derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk managed is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance investment returns. We recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the derivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at gross fair values. The accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation. Cash Flow Hedges We designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States (U.S.) dollar. These contracts have maturities of 24 months or less. Cash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and subsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points and time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI. As of September 30, 2024, the net accumulated loss on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect was $433 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months. Fair Value Hedges We designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our marketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.

The results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements. For certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us, and their creditors do not have recourse to us. As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $4.9 billion and $7.8 billion, respectively and are primarily included in cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs were $2.5 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs that are included within Other Bets. Waymo, a fully autonomous driving technology company and a consolidated VIE, received $4.8 billion in funding during the three months ended September 30, 2024, followed by an additional $860 million in October 2024. The majority of the total funding of $5.6 billion was provided by Alphabet. Investments from external parties were accounted for as equity transactions and resulted in recognition of noncontrolling interests. As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, total noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were $3.4 billion, of which $1.1 billion was redeemable noncontrolling interests (RNCI) for both periods. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was not material for any period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of OI&E. See Note 6 for further details on OI&E. Unconsolidated VIEs We have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private companies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve power generation using renewable sources. We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We account for these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments, which are included within non-marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The total estimated fair value of the outstanding notes was approximately $10.3 billion and $9.5 billion as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, respectively. The fair value was determined based on observable market prices of identical instruments in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

In August 2024, we entered into a license agreement with Character pursuant to which we obtained a non-exclusive license to its current large language model technology.

Indemnifications In the normal course of business, including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate activities, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network partners, distribution partners, customers of Google Cloud offerings, lessors, and service providers with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to defend and/or hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents. It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible.

On September 14, 2022, the General Court reduced the 2018 fine from \u20ac4.3 billion to \u20ac4.1 billion. We subsequently appealed the General Court's decision to the European Court of Justice. On September 10, 2024, the European Court of Justice rejected our appeal of the 2017 decision and upheld the \u20ac2.4 billion fine. In the third quarter of 2024, we made a cash payment of $3.0 billion for the 2017 shopping fine. On September 18, 2024, the EU's General Court overturned the 2019 decision and annulled the \u20ac1.5 billion fine. The EC has until November 28, 2024 to appeal the decision. We included the EC fines, including any under appeal, in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines. For additional information, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Taxes As of September 30, 2024, we had short-term income taxes payable of $2.7 billion, related to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\"). As permitted by the Tax Act, we will pay the remaining transition tax installment in 2025. We also have long-term taxes payable of $8.2 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2024. Purchase Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations As of September 30, 2024, we had material purchase commitments and other contractual obligations of $50.8 billion, of which $31.1 billion was short-term. These amounts primarily consist of purchase orders for certain technical infrastructure as well as the non-cancelable portion or the minimum cancellation fee in certain agreements related to commitments to purchase licenses, including content licenses, inventory, and network capacity. For those agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of September 30, 2024. In certain instances, the amount of our contractual obligations may change based on the expected timing of order fulfillment from our suppliers. For more information related to our content licenses, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, we regularly enter into multi-year, non-cancellable agreements to purchase renewable energy and energy attributes, such as renewable energy certificates. These agreements do not include a minimum dollar commitment. The amounts to be paid under these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated and are not readily determinable.
