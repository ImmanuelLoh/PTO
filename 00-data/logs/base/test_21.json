The TAC rate decreased from 21.8% to 21.4% from 2022 to\n2023 primarily due to a revenue mix shift from Google Network properties to Google Search & other properties. The\nTAC rate on Google Search & other revenues and the TAC rate on Google Network revenues were both substantially\nconsistent from 2022 to 2023.\nThe increase in other cost of revenues from 2022 to 2023 was primarily due to increases in content acquisition\ncosts, largely for YouTube, and compensation expenses, which included $479 million of charges related to employee\nseverance associated with the reduction in our workforce.
