Foreign currency exchange net losses decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to prior year losses in unhedged currencies. In January 2025, we recognized an $8.0 billion unrealized gain on our non-marketable equity securities related to our investment in a private company. The unrealized gain reflects an increase in the fair value measurement of our investment following an observable transaction in January 2025.

Provision for Income Taxes The following table presents provision for income taxes (in millions, except effective tax rate): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2024 2025 2024 2025 Income before provision for income taxes $ 27,551 $ 33,933 $ 55,866 $ 75,722 Provision for income taxes $ 3,932 $ 5,737 $ 8,585 $ 12,986 Effective tax rate 14.3 % 16.9 % 15.4 % 17.1 % The effective tax rate increased from the three months ended June 30, 2024 to the three months ended June 30, 2025. This increase was primarily due to a decrease in SBC-related tax benefits, and a non-deductible legal settlement in the U.S., partially offset by changes in prior period tax positions. The effective tax rate increased from the six months ended June 30, 2024 to the six months ended June 30, 2025. This increase was primarily due to a decrease in SBC-related tax benefits, lower effective tax rate impacts in the U.S. federal Foreign Derived Intangible Income tax deduction, and a non-deductible legal settlement in the U.S., partially offset by changes in prior period tax positions.
