Foreign currency exchange net losses decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to prior year losses in unhedged currencies. In January 2025, we recognized an $8.0 billion unrealized gain on our non-marketable equity securities related to our investment in a private company. The unrealized gain reflects an increase in the fair value measurement of our investment following an observable transaction in January 2025.

Provision for Income Taxes The following table presents provision for income taxes (in millions, except effective tax rate): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2024 2025 2024 2025 Income before provision for income taxes $ 27,551 $ 33,933 $ 55,866 $ 75,722 Provision for income taxes $ 3,932 $ 5,737 $ 8,585 $ 12,986 Effective tax rate 14.3 % 16.9 % 15.4 % 17.1 % The effective tax rate increased from the three months ended June 30, 2024 to the three months ended June 30, 2025. This increase was primarily due to a decrease in SBC-related tax benefits, and a non-deductible legal settlement in the U.S., partially offset by changes in prior period tax positions. The effective tax rate increased from the six months ended June 30, 2024 to the six months ended June 30, 2025. This increase was primarily due to a decrease in SBC-related tax benefits, lower effective tax rate impacts in the U.S. federal Foreign Derived Intangible Income tax deduction, and a non-deductible legal settlement in the U.S., partially offset by changes in prior period tax positions.

An overall increase in data center and other operations costs was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in the estimated useful lives of our servers and certain network equipment. • Operating expenses were $22.1 billion, an increase of 6% year over year, primarily driven by increases in compensation expenses largely due to an increase in stock-based compensation, and charges related to legal matters, partially offset by a decrease in advertising and promotional activities. Additionally, operating expenses benefited from a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in the estimated useful lives of our servers and certain network equipment.

Alphabet-level activities include all of the charges related to employee severance and office space charges. Google Services Google Services operating income increased $4.8 billion from the three months ended March 31, 2024 to the three months ended March 31, 2025. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by an increase in revenues, partially offset by increases in content acquisition costs and TAC.

For the three months ended March 31, 2023, unallocated corporate costs include charges related to the reductions in our workforce and office space totaling $2.5 billion. Google Services Google Services operating income decreased $236 million from the three months ended March 31, 2022 to the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by an increase in compensation expenses, partially offset by the effect of the shift in timing of our annual employee stock-based compensation awards, a reduction in costs driven by the change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment, and growth in revenues. Google Cloud Google Cloud operating income of $191 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to an operating loss of $706 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 represents an increase of $897 million. The increase was primarily driven by revenue growth, partially offset by an increase in compensation expenses. Additionally, operating income benefited from a reduction in costs driven by the change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment and the effect of the shift in timing of our annual employee stock- based compensation awards.
