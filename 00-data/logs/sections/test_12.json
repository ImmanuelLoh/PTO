We report Google in two segments, Google Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For further details on our segments, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Revenues and Monetization Metrics We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and devices. For additional information on how we recognize revenue, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. In addition to the long-term trends and their financial effect on our business discussed in \"Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect\" in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, fluctuations in our revenues have been and may continue to be affected by a combination of factors, including: \u2022 changes in foreign currency exchange rates; \u2022 changes in pricing, such as those resulting from changes in fee structures, discounts, and customer incentives; \u2022 general economic conditions and various external dynamics, including geopolitical events, regulations, and other measures and their effect on advertiser, consumer, and enterprise spending; \u2022 new product and service launches; and \u2022 seasonality. Additionally, fluctuations in our revenues generated from advertising (\"Google advertising\"), revenues from other sources (\"Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues\"), Google Cloud, and Other Bets revenues have been, and may continue to be, affected by other factors unique to each set of revenues, as described below. Google Services Google Services revenues consist of Google advertising as well as Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Please read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with \"Note About Forward-Looking Statements\" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, including Part I, Item 1A \"Risk Factors,\" as updated in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 and in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Understanding Alphabet\u2019s Financial Results Alphabet is a collection of businesses \u2014 the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, Google Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For further details on our segments, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Revenues and Monetization Metrics We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and devices. For additional information on how we recognize revenue, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. In addition to the long-term trends and their financial effect on our business discussed in \"Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect\" in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, fluctuations in our revenues have been and may continue to be affected by a combination of factors, including: \u2022 changes in foreign currency exchange rates; \u2022 changes in pricing, such as those resulting from changes in fee structures, discounts, and customer incentives; \u2022 general economic conditions and various external dynamics, including geopolitical events, regulations, and other measures and their effect on advertiser, consumer, and enterprise spending; \u2022 new product and service launches; and \u2022 seasonality.

Provision for Income Taxes The following table presents provision for income taxes (in millions, except effective tax rate): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2022 2023 2022 2023 Income before provision for income taxes $ 16,233 $ 21,197 $ 54,181 $ 61,305 Provision for income taxes $ 2,323 $ 1,508 $ 7,833 $ 8,197 Effective tax rate 14.3 % 7.1 % 14.5 % 13.4 % On July 21, 2023 the IRS issued a rule change allowing taxpayers to temporarily apply the regulations in effect prior to 2022 related to U.S. federal foreign tax credits. This announcement only applies to foreign taxes paid or accrued in our fiscal years 2022 and 2023. Additionally, on September 8, 2023, the IRS issued a separate rule change with interim guidance on the capitalization and amortization of R&D expenses. A cumulative one-time adjustment applicable to prior periods for these tax rule changes was recorded in the third quarter of 2023. The effective tax rate decreased from the three months ended September 30, 2022 to the three months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting the effect of the two tax rule changes, particularly the change related to foreign tax credits. The effect of these tax rule changes was partially offset by a decrease in the U.S. federal Foreign Derived Intangible Income tax deduction. The effective tax rate decreased from the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting the effect of the two tax rule changes, particularly the change related to foreign tax credits. The effect of these tax rule changes was partially offset by changes in uncertain tax benefits, a decrease in the stock-based compensation-related tax benefit, and a decrease in the U.S. federal Foreign Derived Intangible Income tax deduction. Financial Condition Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities As of September 30, 2023, we had $119.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly liquid government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, and marketable equity securities. Sources, Uses of Cash and Related Trends Our principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from operations. The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long-term growth of the business. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace, and form of capital return to stockholders.
