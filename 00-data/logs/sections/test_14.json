We expect that this shift to an online world will continue to benefit our business and our revenues,\nalthough at a slower pace than we have experienced historically, in particular after the outsized growth in our\nadvertising revenues during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we face increasing competition for user engagement\nand advertisers, which may affect our revenues.\n\u2022 Users continue to access our products and services using diverse devices and modalities, which\nallows for new advertising formats that may benefit our revenues but adversely affect our margins.\nOur users are accessing the Internet via diverse devices and modalities, such as smartphones, wearables, and\nsmart home devices, and want to be able to be connected no matter where they are or what they are doing. We are\nfocused on expanding our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to maintain and grow our\nbusiness.\nWe benefit from advertising revenues generated from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising\nformats. The margins from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional\ndesktop search. Additionally, as the market for a particular device type or modality matures, our advertising revenues\nmay be affected. For example, growth in the global smartphone market has slowed due to various factors, including\nincreased market saturation in developed countries, which can affect our mobile advertising revenues.\nWe expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our revenues grow\nand TAC as a percentage of our advertising revenues (\"TAC rate\") to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic\nmix; partner mix; partner agreement terms; the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points; product\nmix; the relative revenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels; and revenue share terms.\nWe expect these trends to continue to affect our revenues and put pressure on our margins.\n\u2022 As online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings, which may affect our\nmonetization.\nAs interactions between users and advertisers change, and as online user behavior evolves, we continue to\nexpand our product offerings to serve these changing needs, which may affect our monetization. For example,\nrevenues from ads on YouTube and Google Play monetize at a lower rate than our traditional search ads. We also may\ndevelop new products incorporating AI innovations that could affect our monetization trends. Additionally, when\ndeveloping new products and services we generally focus first on user experience before prioritizing monetization.\n\u2022 As users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets\ncontinue to increase, and may require continued investments. In addition, movements in foreign exchange\nrates affect such revenues.\nThe shift to online, as well as the advent of the multi-device world, has brought opportunities outside of the U.S.,\nincluding in emerging markets, such as India. We continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our\nproducts and advertising programs relevant to our users in these markets. This has led to a trend of increased\n26",

Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to\nrevenue are not allocated to our segments.\nOur Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is our Chief Executive Officer, Sundar Pichai. Our CODM uses\nsegment operating income (loss) to allocate resources to our segments in our annual planning process and to\nassess the performance of our segments, primarily by monitoring actual results versus the annual plan.

Information about Segments and Geographic Areas\nWe report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:\n\u2022 Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Google Maps,\nGoogle Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; fees\nreceived for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and\nNFL Sunday Ticket; the sale of apps and in-app purchases and devices.\n\u2022 Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for\nenterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from consumption-based fees and\nsubscriptions received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and\ncollaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\n\u2022 Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from\nOther Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.\nRevenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering\nactivities, and devices, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the\nintegrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are\nmanaged centrally at a consolidated level. These costs, including the associated depreciation and impairment, are\nallocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage, headcount, or revenue.\nReflecting DeepMind's increasing collaboration with Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets, beginning in\nthe first quarter of 2023 DeepMind is reported as part of Alphabet-level activities instead of within Other Bets.\nAdditionally, beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we updated and simplified our cost allocation methodologies to\nprovide our business leaders with increased transparency for decision-making. Prior periods have been recast to\nconform to the current presentation.\nAs announced on April 20, 2023, we brought together part of Google Research (the Brain team) and DeepMind to\nsignificantly accelerate our progress in artificial intelligence (AI). The group, called Google DeepMind, is reported within\nAlphabet-level activities prospectively beginning in the second quarter of 2023. Previously, the Brain team was\nincluded within Google Services.\nCertain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs\nprimarily include AI-focused shared R&D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; corporate\ninitiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and\nlegal costs, including certain fines and settlements. Charges associated with reductions in our workforce and office\nspace during 2023 were not allocated to our segments. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are not\nallocated to our segments.\nOur operating segments are not evaluated using asset information.\nThe following table presents information about our segments (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021 2022 2023\nRevenues:\nGoogle Services $ 237,529 $ 253,528 $ 272,543\nGoogle Cloud 19,206 26,280 33,088\nOther Bets 753 1,068 1,527\nHedging gains (losses) 149 1,960 236\nTotal revenues $ 257,637 $ 282,836 $ 307,394\nOperating income (loss):\nGoogle Services $ 88,132 $ 82,699 $ 95,858\nGoogle Cloud (2,282) (1,922) 1,716\nOther Bets (4,051) (4,636) (4,095)\nAlphabet-level activities (3,085) (1,299) (9,186)\nTotal income from operations $ 78,714 $ 74,842 $ 84,293\nSee Note 2 for information relating to revenues by geography.\n86.",
