See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information. Provision for Income Taxes The following table presents provision for income taxes (in millions, except effective tax rate): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2022 2023 2022 2023 Income before provision for income taxes $ 16,233 $ 21,197 $ 54,181 $ 61,305 Provision for income taxes $ 2,323 $ 1,508 $ 7,833 $ 8,197 Effective tax rate 14.3 % 7.1 % 14.5 % 13.4 % On July 21, 2023 the IRS issued a rule change allowing taxpayers to temporarily apply the regulations in effect prior to 2022 related to U.S. federal foreign tax credits. This announcement only applies to foreign taxes paid or accrued in our fiscal years 2022 and 2023. Additionally, on September 8, 2023, the IRS issued a separate rule change with interim guidance on the capitalization and amortization of R&D expenses. A cumulative one-time adjustment applicable to prior periods for these tax rule changes was recorded in the third quarter of 2023. The effective tax rate decreased from the three months ended September 30, 2022 to the three months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting the effect of the two tax rule changes, particularly the change related to foreign tax credits. The effect of these tax rule changes was partially offset by a decrease in the U.S. federal Foreign Derived Intangible Income tax deduction. The effective tax rate decreased from the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting the effect of the two tax rule changes, particularly the change related to foreign tax credits. The effect of these tax rule changes was partially offset by changes in uncertain tax benefits, a decrease in the stock-based compensation-related tax benefit, and a decrease in the U.S. federal Foreign Derived Intangible Income tax deduction. Financial Condition Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities As of September 30, 2023, we had $119.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly liquid government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, and marketable equity securities. Sources, Uses of Cash and Related Trends Our principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from operations. The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long-term growth of the business. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace, and form of capital return to stockholders. The following table presents our cash flows (in millions): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 67,881 $ 82,831 Net cash used in investing activities $ (14,071) $ (20,896) Net cash used in financing activities $ (52,128) $ (52,785) Cash Provided by Operating Activities Our largest source of cash provided",
