The increase in TAC from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months ended March 31, 2024 was largely due to an increase in TAC paid to distribution partners, primarily driven by growth in revenues subject to TAC. The TAC rate decreased from 21.5% to 21.0% from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months ended March 31, 2024 primarily due to a revenue mix shift from Google Network properties to Google Search & other properties. The TAC rate on Google Search & other revenues was substantially consistent from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months ended March 31, 2024. The TAC rate on Google Network revenues reflected a slight increase from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months ended March 31, 2024 due to a combination of factors, none of which were individually significant. The increase in other cost of revenues from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months ended March 31, 2024 was primarily due to increases in content acquisition costs, largely for YouTube, and depreciation expense. These increases were partially offset by decreases in compensation expenses, largely the result of a reduction in employee severance and related charges of $308 million, and charges related to our office space optimization efforts of $220 million.

Additionally, a decrease in compensation expenses of $64 million was primarily the result of a reduction in employee severance and related charges of $588 million. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in SBC expense of $320 million, excluding employee severance and related charges.
