It is hard to predict the challenges we may encounter\nin adapting our products and services and developing competitive new products and services. We expect to continue\nto devote significant resources to creating and supporting products and services across multiple platforms and devices.\nFailing to attract and retain a substantial number of new device manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, developers, and\nusers, or failing to develop products and technologies that work well on new devices and platforms, could harm our\nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results and ability to capture future business opportunities.\nIssues in the development and use of AI may result in reputational harm and increased liability exposure.\nOur evolving AI-related efforts may give rise to risks related to harmful content, inaccuracies, discrimination,\nintellectual property infringement or misappropriation, defamation, data privacy, cybersecurity, and other issues. As a\nresult of these and other challenges associated with innovative technologies, our implementation of AI systems could\nsubject us to competitive harm, regulatory action, legal liability (including under new and proposed legislation and\nregulations), new applications of existing data protection, privacy, intellectual property, and other laws, and brand or\nreputational harm.\nSome uses of AI will present ethical issues and may have broad effects on society. In order to implement AI\nresponsibly and minimize unintended harmful effects, we have already devoted and will continue to invest significant\nresources to develop, test, and maintain our products and services, but we may not be able to identify or resolve all AI-\nrelated issues, deficiencies, and/or failures before they arise. Unintended consequences, uses, or customization of our\nAI tools and systems may negatively affect human rights, privacy, employment, or other social concerns, which may\nresult in claims, lawsuits, brand or reputational harm, and increased regulatory scrutiny, any of which could harm our\nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results.\nData privacy and security concerns relating to our technology and our practices could harm our\nreputation, cause us to incur significant liability, and deter current and potential users or customers from\nusing our products and services. Computer viruses, software bugs or defects, security breaches, and attacks\non our systems could result in the improper disclosure and use of user data and interference with our users\u2019\nand customers\u2019 ability to use our products and services, harming our business and reputation.\nConcerns about, including the adequacy of, our practices with regard to the collection, use, governance,\ndisclosure, or security of personal data or other data-privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could harm our\nbusiness, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Our policies and practices may change over time as\nexpectations and regulations regarding privacy and data change.\nOur products and services involve the storage, handling, and transmission of proprietary and other sensitive\ninformation. Software bugs, theft, misuse, defects, vulnerabilities in our products and services, and security breaches\nexpose us to a risk of loss or improper use and disclosure of such information, which could result in litigation and other\npotential liabilities, including regulatory fines and penalties, as well as reputational harm. Additionally, our products\nincorporate highly technical and complex technologies, and thus our technologies and software have contained, and\nare likely in the future to contain, undetected errors, bugs, and/or vulnerabilities. We continue to add new features\ninvolving AI to our offerings and internal systems, and features that rely on AI may be susceptible to unanticipated\nsecurity threats as our and the market\u2019s understanding of AI-centric security risks and protection methods continue to\ndevelop. We have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, some errors in our software code only after\nwe have released the code. Systems and control failures, security breaches, failure to comply with our privacy policies,\nand/or inadvertent disclosure of user data could result in government and legal exposure, seriously harm our\nreputation, brand, and business, and impair our ability to attract and retain users or customers. Such incidents have\noccurred in the past and may continue to occur due to the scale and nature of our products and services. While there\nis no guarantee that such incidents will not cause significant damage, we expect to continue to expend significant\nresources to maintain security protections that limit the effect of bugs, theft, misuse, and security vulnerabilities or\nbreaches.\nWe experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis.\nCyber attacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods\nof time. We have seen, and will continue to see, industry-wide software supply chain vulnerabilities, which could affect\nour or other parties\u2019 systems. We expect to continue to experience such incidents or vulnerabilities in the future. Our\nefforts to address undesirable activity on our platform may also increase the risk of retaliatory attack. In addition, we\nface the risk of cyber attacks by nation-states and state-sponsored actors. These attacks may target us or our\ncustomers, particularly our public sector customers (including federal, state, and local governments). Geopolitical\ntensions or armed conflicts, such as the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and Ukraine, may increase these risks.\nWe may experience security issues, whether due to employee or insider error or malfeasance, system errors, or\nvulnerabilities in our or other parties\u2019 systems.

If the quality of our products and services does not meet expectations or our products or\nservices are defective, it could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe require our suppliers and business partners to comply with laws and, where applicable, our company policies\nand practices, such as the Google Supplier Code of Conduct, regarding workplace and employment practices, data\nsecurity, environmental compliance, and intellectual property licensing, but we do not control them or their practices.\nViolations of law or unethical business practices could result in supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, harm to key\nrelationships, and damage to our reputation. Their failure to procure necessary license rights to intellectual property\ncould affect our ability to sell our products or services and expose us to litigation or financial claims.\nInterruption to, interference with, or failure of our complex information technology and communications\nsystems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services, which could harm our\nreputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nThe availability of our products and services and fulfillment of our customer contracts depend on the continuing\noperation of our information technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable to damage,\ninterference, or interruption from modifications or upgrades, terrorist attacks, state-sponsored attacks, natural disasters\nor pandemics, geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought,\nflooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention,\nand increased storm severity), power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, software bugs, ransomware\nattacks, computer denial of service attacks, phishing schemes, or other attempts to harm or access our systems.

Our data\ncenters are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism, and, in some cases, to potential\ndisruptions resulting from problems experienced by facility operators or disruptions as a result of geopolitical tensions\nand conflicts happening in the area. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and disaster recovery planning\ncannot account for all eventualities.

International revenues accounted for approximately 51% of our consolidated revenues in 2022. In\naddition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international operations expose us to other risks, including the\nfollowing:\n\u2022 restrictions on foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent\nus from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.;\n\u2022 import and export requirements, tariffs, and other market access barriers that may prevent or impede us from\noffering products or providing services to a particular market, or that could limit our ability to source assemblies\nand finished products from a particular market, and may increase our operating costs;\n\u2022 longer payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud;\n\u2022 an evolving foreign policy landscape that may adversely affect our revenues and could subject us to new\nregulatory costs and challenges (including new customer requirements), in addition to other adverse effects\nthat we are unable to effectively anticipate;\n\u2022 sanctions, export controls, and trade restrictions that limit our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions or to\ncomply with local laws, including as a result of geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, such as the ongoing\nconflict in Ukraine;\n\u2022 political unrest, conflict, and changes in governmental regimes that may adversely affect demand and usage of\nour products and services, may limit the ability for people in certain areas to access and use our products and\nservices, or may impede us from offering products or providing services to a particular market;\n\u2022 anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting certain\npayments to government officials, violations of which could result in civil and criminal penalties;\n13",
