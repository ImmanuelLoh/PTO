EMEA revenue growth was not materially affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as the effect of the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Turkish lira was largely offset by the U.S. dollar weakening relative to the British pound and the Euro. APAC revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Japanese yen. Other Americas revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Argentine peso. Costs and Expenses Cost of Revenues The following table presents cost of revenues, including TAC (in millions, except percentages): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2023 2024 2023 2024 TAC $ 12,537 $ 13,387 $ 24,258 $ 26,333 Other cost of revenues 19,379 22,120 38,270 42,886 Total cost of revenues $ 31,916 $ 35,507 $ 62,528 $ 69,219 Total cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues 43 % 42 % 43 % 42 % Cost of revenues increased $3.6 billion from the three months ended June 30, 2023 to the three months ended June 30, 2024 due to an increase in other cost of revenues and TAC of $2.7 billion and $850 million, respectively. Cost of revenues increased $6.7 billion from the six months ended June 30, 2023 to the six months ended June 30, 2024 due to an increase in other cost of revenues and TAC of $4.6 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. The increase in TAC from the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 was largely due to an increase in TAC paid to distribution partners, primarily driven by growth in revenues subject to TAC. The TAC rate decreased from 21.6% to 20.7% from the three months ended June 30, 2023 to the three months ended June 30, 2024 and decreased from 21.5% to 20.9% from the six months ended June 30, 2023 to the six months ended June 30, 2024,",
