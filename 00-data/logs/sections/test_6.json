Cost of revenues increased $2.8 billion from the six months ended June 30, 2022 to the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in other cost of revenues of $2.8 billion. The increase in TAC from the three months ended June 30, 2022 to the three months ended June 30, 2023 was largely due to an increase in TAC paid to distribution partners, primarily driven by growth in revenues subject to TAC. TAC was relatively unchanged from the six months ended June 30, 2022 to the six months ended June 30, 2023. The TAC rate decreased from 21.7% to 21.6% from the three months ended June 30, 2022 to the three months ended June 30, 2023 and decreased from 21.8% to 21.5% from the six months ended June 30, 2022 to the six months ended June 30, 2023 primarily due to a revenue mix shift from Google Network properties to Google Search & other properties. The TAC rate on Google Search & other revenues and the TAC rate on Google Network revenues were both substantially consistent from the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase in other cost of revenues from the three months ended June 30, 2022 to the three months ended June 30, 2023 was primarily due to increases in content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, and hardware costs. An overall increase in data center and other operations costs was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in the estimated useful lives of our servers and certain network equipment. The increase in other cost of revenues from the six months ended June 30, 2022 to the six months ended June 30, 2023 was primarily due to increases in content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, and data center and other operations costs. The overall increase in data center and other operations costs includes $700 million of charges related to employee severance associated with the reduction of our workforce and our office space optimization efforts, partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in the estimated useful lives of our servers and certain network equipment.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Please read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with \u201cNote about Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d Part I, Item 1 \"Business,\" Part I, Item 1A \"Risk Factors,\" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have omitted discussion of 2020 results where it would be redundant to the discussion previously included in Item 7 of our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Understanding Alphabet\u2019s Financial Results Alphabet is a collection of businesses \u2014 the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, Google Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For further details on our segments, see Part I, Item 1 \u201cBusiness\u201d and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect The following long-term trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate that they will continue to affect our future results: \u2022 Users' behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves. The continuing shift from an offline to online world has contributed to the growth of our business and our revenues since inception. We expect that this shift to an online world will continue to benefit our business and our revenues, although at a slower pace than we have experienced historically, in particular after the outsized growth in our advertising revenues during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we face increasing competition for user engagement and advertisers, which may affect our revenues. \u2022 Users continue to access our products and services using diverse devices and modalities, which allows for new advertising formats that may benefit our revenues but adversely affect our margins. Our users are accessing the Internet via diverse devices and modalities, such as smartphones, wearables, and smart home devices, and want to be able to be connected no matter where they are or what they are doing. We are focused on expanding our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to maintain and grow our business. We benefit from advertising revenues generated from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising formats. The margins from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional desktop search. Additionally, as the market for a particular device type or modality matures, our advertising revenues may be affected. For example, growth in the global smartphone market has slowed due to various factors, including increased market saturation in developed countries, which can affect our mobile advertising revenues. We expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our revenues grow and TAC as a percentage of our advertising revenues (\"TAC rate\") to be affected by changes in device",

The increase in TAC from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was largely due to an increase in TAC paid to distribution partners, primarily driven by growth in revenues subject to TAC. The TAC rate decreased from 21.2% to 20.8% from the three months ended September 30, 2023 to the three months ended September 30, 2024 and decreased from 21.4% to 20.8% from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a revenue mix shift from Google Network properties to Google Search & other properties. The TAC rate on Google Search & other revenues increased from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to increases related to mobile searches, which carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points.

The increase in other cost of revenues from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to increases in content acquisition costs, largely for YouTube, depreciation expense, other technical infrastructure operations costs, and third-party service fees.

Costs and Expenses Our cost structure has two components: cost of revenues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses include costs related to R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of our costs and expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues. \u2022 TAC includes: \u25e6 Amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers. \u25e6 Amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties. \u2022 Other cost of revenues includes: \u25e6 Content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee). \u25e6 Expenses associated with our data centers (including bandwidth, compensation expenses, depreciation, energy, and other equipment costs) as well as other operations costs (such as content review as well as customer and product support costs). \u25e6 Inventory and other costs related to the hardware we sell. TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly higher than TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search & other properties, because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners. Operating Expenses Operating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as either R&D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative. The main components of our R&D expenses are: \u2022 compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&D related to our existing and new products and services; \u2022 depreciation; and \u2022 third-party services fees primarily relating to consulting and outsourced services in support of our engineering and product development efforts. 29",

We use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our advertising revenues: paid clicks and cost-per-click pertain to traffic on Google Search & other properties, while impressions and cost-per-impression pertain to traffic on our Google Network properties. Paid clicks represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users on Google search properties and other Google owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play.

Fluctuations in our advertising revenues, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search & other properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties and the correlation between these items have been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition to the general factors described above, such as: \u2022 advertiser competition for keywords; \u2022 changes in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy; \u2022 changes in device mix; \u2022 seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends, such as traditional retail seasonality; and \u2022 traffic growth in emerging markets",

In January 2025, we recognized an $8.0 billion unrealized gain on our non-marketable equity securities related to our investment in a private company.

Software Development Costs We expense software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, before technological feasibility is reached. Technological feasibility is typically reached shortly before the release of such products. As a result, development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented. Software development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and cloud-based applications used to deliver our services. We capitalize development costs related to these software applications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications were not material for the periods presented. Stock-based Compensation Stock-based compensation (SBC) primarily consists of Alphabet restricted stock units (RSUs). RSUs are equity classified and measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. We recognize RSU expense using the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur. RSUs are awarded dividend equivalents, which are subject to the same vesting conditions as the underlying award, and settled in Class C shares. For RSUs, shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory income tax withholding to be paid by us on behalf of our employees. As a result, fewer shares are issued than the number of RSUs outstanding, and the income tax withholding is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital. Additionally, SBC includes other stock-based awards, such as performance stock units (PSUs) that include market conditions and awards that may be settled in cash or the stock of certain Other Bet companies. PSUs and certain awards granted by Other Bet companies are equity classified and expense is recognized over the requisite service period. Certain awards granted by Other Bet companies are liability classified and remeasured at fair value through settlement. The fair value of awards granted by Other Bet companies is based on the equity valuation of the respective Other Bet company. Advertising and Promotional Expenses We expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $9.2 billion, $8.7 billion, and $8.7 billion, respectively. Performance Fees Performance fees refer to compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain investments. We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may result in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid",

Software Development Costs We expense software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, before technological feasibility is reached. Technological feasibility is typically reached shortly before the release of such products. As a result, development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented.

Stock-based Compensation Stock-based compensation (SBC) primarily consists of Alphabet restricted stock units (RSUs). RSUs are equity classified and measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. We recognize RSU expense using the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur. For RSUs, shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory income tax withholding to be paid by us on behalf of our employees. As a result, fewer shares are issued than the number of RSUs outstanding, and the income tax withholding is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital. Additionally, SBC includes other stock-based awards, such as performance stock units (PSUs) that include market conditions and awards that may be settled in cash or the stock of certain Other Bet companies. PSUs and certain awards granted by Other Bet companies are equity classified and expense is recognized over the requisite service period. Certain awards granted by Other Bet companies are liability classified and remeasured at fair value through settlement.

If the carrying value of the assets or asset group is not recoverable, the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Income Taxes We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which we recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We measure current and deferred tax assets and liabilities based on provisions of enacted tax law. We evaluate the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets based on all available evidence and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized or release a valuation allowance to increase deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will be realized. We have elected to account for the tax effects of the global intangible low tax Income provision as a current period expense. We recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that, based on technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The tax benefits of the position recognized in the financial statements are then measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. In addition, we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision. Business Combinations We include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the acquisition date. We allocate the purchase price of the acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, except for revenue contracts acquired, which are recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred. Foreign Currency We translate the financial statements of our international subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities, and average rates for the annual period derived from month-end exchange rates for revenues, costs, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in AOCI as a component of stockholders\u2019 equity.

As permitted by the Tax Act, we will pay the transition tax in annual interest-free installments through 2025. We also have long-term taxes payable of $5.9 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2023. As a result of the 2023 IRS payment deferral relief made available to taxpayers headquartered in designated counties in California, we postponed our second and third quarter U.S. federal income tax payments. On October 16, 2023, we made an estimated income tax payment to the IRS of $10.5 billion.

Purchase Commitments As of September 30, 2023, we had material contractual obligations of $44.3 billion, of which $29.4 billion was short-term. These amounts primarily consist of purchase orders for certain technical infrastructure as well as the non-cancelable portion or the minimum cancellation fee in certain agreements related to commitments to purchase licenses, including content licenses, inventory and network capacity. For those agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of September 30, 2023.

The provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the related net interest and penalties. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Loss Contingencies We are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our disclosures. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters. Until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity investment risks. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We transact business globally in multiple currencies. International revenues, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. As discussed below, we enter into derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency risk. Principal currencies hedged included the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro, and Japanese yen. For the purpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk, we considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% could be experienced. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. These forward and option contracts reduce, but",
