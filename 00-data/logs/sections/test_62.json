An overall increase in data center and other operations costs was\npartially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in the estimated useful lives of our\nservers and certain network equipment.\n\u2022 Operating expenses were $22.1 billion, an increase of 6% year over year, primarily driven by increases in\ncompensation expenses largely due to an increase in stock-based compensation, and charges related to\nlegal matters, partially offset by a decrease in advertising and promotional activities. Additionally, operating\nexpenses benefited from a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in the estimated useful\nlives of our servers and certain network equipment.\nOther Information\n\u2022 In January 2023, we announced a reduction of our workforce, and as a result we recorded employee\nseverance and related charges of $86 million and $2.1 billion for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, respectively. In addition, we are taking actions to optimize our global office space. As\na result, exit charges recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were $16\nmillion and $649 million, respectively. In addition to these exit charges, for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, we incurred $207 million in accelerated rent and accelerated depreciation. We may\n37",
