The increase in TAC from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months ended March 31, 2024 was largely due to an increase in TAC paid to distribution partners, primarily driven by growth in revenues subject to TAC. The TAC rate decreased from 21.5% to 21.0% from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months ended March 31, 2024 primarily due to a revenue mix shift from Google Network properties to Google Search & other properties. The TAC rate on Google Search & other revenues was substantially consistent from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months ended March 31, 2024. The TAC rate on Google Network revenues reflected a slight increase from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months ended March 31, 2024 due to a combination of factors, none of which were individually significant. The increase in other cost of revenues from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months ended March 31, 2024 was primarily due to increases in content acquisition costs, largely for YouTube, and depreciation expense.

Other Americas revenue growth from the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 was not materially affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Costs and Expenses Cost of Revenues The following table presents cost of revenues, including TAC (in millions, except percentages): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2021 2022 2021 2022 TAC $ 10,929 $ 12,214 $ 20,641 $ 24,204 Other cost of revenues 15,298 17,890 29,689 35,499 Total cost of revenues $ 26,227 $ 30,104 $ 50,330 $ 59,703 Total cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues 42.4 % 43.2 % 42.9 % 43.4 % Cost of revenues increased $3.9 billion from the three months ended June 30, 2021 to the three months ended June 30, 2022. The increase was due to increases in other cost of revenues and TAC of $2.6 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. Cost of revenues increased $9.4 billion from the six months ended June 30, 2021 to the six months ended June 30, 2022. The increase was due to increases in other cost of revenues and TAC of $5.8 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. The increase in TAC from the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 was due to increases in TAC paid to distribution partners and to Google Network partners, primarily driven by growth in revenues subject to TAC. The TAC rate was 21.7% in both the three months ended June 30, 2021 and the three months ended June 30, 2022. The TAC rate increased from 21.7% to 21.8% from the six months ended June 30, 2021 to the six months ended June 30, 2022 due to a combination of factors, none of which were individually significant. The TAC rate on Google Search & other properties revenues and the TAC rate on Google Network revenues were both substantially consistent from three and six months ended June 30, 2021 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2022. The increase in other cost of revenues from the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily due to increases in data center and other operations costs, including depreciation expense, as well as content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube. Research and Development The following table presents R&D expenses (in millions, except percentages): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2021 2022 2021 2022 Research and development expenses $ 7,675 $ 9,841 $ 15,160 $ 18,960 Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues 12.4 % 14.1 % 12.9 % 13.8 % R&D expenses increased $2.2 billion from the three months ended June 30, 2021 to the three months ended June 30, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in compensation expenses of $1.4 billion, largely resulting from a 18% increase in headcount,",

APAC revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Japanese yen.

EMEA revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the euro. APAC revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Japanese yen, Australian dollar, and South Korean won. Other Americas revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Brazilian real.

The increase in TAC from the three months ended March 31, 2024 to the three months ended March 31, 2025 was largely due to an increase in TAC paid to distribution partners, primarily driven by growth in revenues subject to TAC. The TAC rate decreased from 21.0% to 20.6% from the three months ended March 31, 2024 to the three months ended March 31, 2025 primarily due to a revenue mix shift from Google Network properties to Google Search & other properties. The TAC rate on Google Search & other revenues increased from the three months ended March 31, 2024 to the three months ended March 31, 2025 primarily due to increases related to mobile searches, which carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points. The TAC rate on Google Network revenues decreased from the three months ended March 31, 2024",

The increase was primarily due to fluctuations in the value of equity securities reflecting market driven changes in the value of our marketable equity securities, investment specific event driven changes in our non-marketable equity securities, and increased interest income due to interest rates. For additional information, see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Provision for Income Taxes The following table presents provision for income taxes (in millions, except for effective tax rate): Year Ended December 31, 2022 2023 Income before provision for income taxes $ 71,328 $ 85,717 Provision for income taxes $ 11,356 $ 11,922 Effective tax rate 15.9 % 13.9 % In 2023, the Internal Revenue Services (IRS) issued a rule change allowing taxpayers to temporarily apply the regulations in effect prior to 2022 related to U.S. federal foreign tax credits, as well as a separate rule change with interim guidance on the capitalization and amortization of R&D expenses. A cumulative one-time adjustment applicable to the prior period for these tax rule changes was recorded in 2023. The effective tax rate decreased from 2022 to 2023, reflecting the effect of the two tax rule changes described above, particularly the change related to foreign tax credits. The effect of these tax rule changes was partially offset by changes in uncertain tax benefits and a decrease in the U.S. federal Foreign Derived Intangible Income tax deduction. The OECD is coordinating negotiations among more than 140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus around substantial changes to international tax policies, including the implementation of a minimum global effective tax rate of 15%. While various countries have implemented the legislation as of January 1, 2024, we do not expect a resulting material change to our income tax provision for the 2024 fiscal year. As additional jurisdictions enact such legislation, we expect our effective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase in future years. Financial Condition Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities As of December 31, 2023, we had $110.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly liquid government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, and marketable equity securities. Sources, Uses of Cash and Related Trends Our principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from operations. The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for",

Cost of revenues increased $6.2 billion from the six months ended June 30, 2024 to the six months ended June 30, 2025 due to an increase in other cost of revenues and TAC of $4.1 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. The increase in TAC from the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 was largely due to an increase in TAC paid to distribution partners, primarily driven by growth in revenues subject to TAC. The TAC rate decreased from 20.7% to 20.6% from the three months ended June 30, 2024 to the three months ended June 30, 2025 and decreased from 20.9% to 20.6% from the six months ended June 30, 2024 to the six months ended June 30, 2025, primarily due to a revenue mix shift from Google Network properties to Google Search & other properties partially offset by an increase in the Google Search & other TAC rate. The TAC rate on Google Search & other revenues increased from the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 primarily due to increases related to mobile searches. The TAC rate on Google Network revenues was substantially consistent from the three months ended June 30, 2024 to the three months ended June 30, 2025 and decreased from the six months ended June 30, 2024 to the six months ended June 30, 2025 due to a combination of factors, none of which were individually significant. The increase in other cost of revenues from the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 was primarily due to increases in content acquisition costs, largely for YouTube, depreciation expense, and certain app and platform distribution costs.
