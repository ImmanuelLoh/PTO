Additionally, a reduction in employee compensation expenses contributed to the increase in operating income. Google Cloud Google Cloud operating income increased $4.4 billion from 2023 to 2024. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by an increase in revenues, partially offset by increases in usage costs for technical infrastructure as well as employee compensation expenses, largely driven by headcount growth. Other Bets Other Bets operating loss increased $349 million from 2023 to 2024. The increase in operating loss was primarily due to an increase in expenses, largely driven by employee compensation expenses in addition to a combination of factors, none of which were individually significant.

The net gains on equity securities were primarily due to net unrealized gains on non-marketable equity securities driven by fair value adjustments related to observable transactions, partially offset by a decrease in net unrealized gains on marketable equity securities due to market-driven changes. Foreign currency exchange net losses decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to prior year losses in unhedged currencies. In January 2025, we recognized an $8.0 billion unrealized gain on our non-marketable equity securities related to our investment in a private company. The unrealized gain reflects an increase in the fair value measurement of our investment following an observable transaction in January 2025.
