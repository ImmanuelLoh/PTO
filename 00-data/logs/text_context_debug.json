The increase in operating income was primarily driven by an increase in revenues, partially offset by increases in TAC and content acquisition costs. Additionally, a reduction in compensation expenses contributed to the increase in operating income. Google Cloud Google Cloud operating income increased $1.7 billion and $3.2 billion from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by an increase in revenues, partially offset by increases in usage costs for technical infrastructure assets as well as compensation expenses, largely driven by headcount growth. Other Bets Other Bets operating loss decreased $78 million from the three months ended September 30, 2023 to the three months ended September 30, 2024, due to a combination of factors, none of which were individually significant. Other Bets operating loss increased $38 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in operating loss was primarily due to an increase in expenses, largely driven by compensation expenses, partially offset by an increase in revenues. The increase in compensation expenses was primarily as a result of the reduction in valuation-based compensation liabilities related to certain Other Bets recognized in the prior year comparable period.

The increase was primarily due to an increase in net unrealized gains on equity securities driven by fair value adjustments related to observable transactions and market driven changes, and increased net gains on debt securities. OI&E increased $5.4 billion from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net unrealized gains on non-marketable equity securities driven by fair value adjustments related to observable transactions and increased interest income related to higher interest rates.

Additionally, a reduction in compensation expenses contributed to the increase in operating income. Google Cloud Google Cloud operating income increased $1.7 billion and $3.2 billion from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.

The increase in operating loss was primarily due to an increase in expenses, largely driven by compensation expenses, partially offset by an increase in revenues. The increase in compensation expenses was primarily as a result of the reduction in valuation-based compensation liabilities related to certain Other Bets recognized in the prior year comparable period. Other Income (Expense), Net The following table presents OI&E (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2023 2024 2023 2024 Interest income $ 1,066 $ 1,243 $ 2,755 $ 3,394 Interest expense (116) (54) (239) (215) Foreign currency exchange gain (loss), net (311) 23 (789) (388) Gain (loss) on debt securities, net (503) 160 (1,100) (612) Gain (loss) on equity securities, net (366) 1,821 (194) 3,350 Performance fees 179 29 302 261 Income (loss) and impairment from equity method investments, net (215) (107) (372) (101) Other 120 70 346 465 Other income (expense), net $ (146) $ 3,185 $ 709 $ 6,154 OI&E increased $3.3 billion from the three months ended September 30, 2023 to the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net unrealized gains on equity securities driven by fair value adjustments related to observable transactions and market driven changes, and increased net gains on debt securities. OI&E increased $5.4 billion from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net unrealized gains on non-marketable equity securities driven by fair value adjustments related to observable transactions and increased interest income related to higher interest rates.

The increase in operating income was primarily driven by an increase in revenues, partially offset by an increase in compensation expenses and content acquisition costs. Additionally, operating income benefited from a reduction in costs driven by the change in the estimated useful lives of our servers and certain network equipment. Google Cloud Google Cloud operating income of $395 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to an operating loss of $590 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 represents an increase of $985 million.
