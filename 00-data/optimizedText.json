BUSINESS\nOverview\nAs our founders Larry and Sergey wrote in the original founders' letter, \"Google is not a conventional company.\nWe do not intend to become one.\" That unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history, inspiring\nus to tackle big problems and invest in moonshots, such as our long-term opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI). We\ncontinue this work under the leadership of Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai.\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses \u2014 the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments,\nGoogle Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Alphabet's\nstructure is about helping each of our businesses prosper through strong leaders and independence.\nAccess and technology for everyone\nThe Internet is one of the world\u2019s most powerful equalizers; it propels ideas, people and businesses large and\nsmall. Our mission to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant\ntoday as it was when we were founded in 1998. Since then, we have evolved from a company that helps people find\nanswers to a company that also helps people get things done.\nWe are focused on building an even more helpful Google for everyone, and we aspire to give everyone the tools\nthey need to increase their knowledge, health, happiness, and success. Google Search helps people find information\nand make sense of the world in more natural and intuitive ways, with trillions of searches on Google every year.\nYouTube provides people with entertainment, information, and opportunities to learn something new. Google Assistant\noffers the best way to get things done seamlessly across different devices, providing intelligent help throughout a\nperson's day, no matter where they are. Google Cloud helps customers solve today\u2019s business challenges, improve\nproductivity, reduce costs, and unlock new growth engines. We are continually innovating and building new products\nand features that will help our users, partners, customers, and communities and have invested more than $100 billion\nin research and development in the last five years in support of these efforts.\n4"

This\nincrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not\nevolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android and when we launched Chrome,\nbut those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer, popular browser.\nWe continue to look toward the future and to invest for the long term within each of our segments. As we said in the\noriginal founders' letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in, as they are the\nkey to our long-term success.\nThe power of AI\nWe believe that AI is a foundational and transformational technology that will provide compelling and helpful\nbenefits to people and society through its capacity to assist, complement, empower, and inspire people in almost every\nfield of human endeavor. As an information and computer science company, we will continue to be at the forefront of\nadvancing the frontier of AI. Through our path-breaking and field-defining research and development, we responsibly\nand boldly develop more capable and useful AI every day.\nAI already powers Google\u2019s core products that help billions of people every day and has been at the foundation of\nour core ads quality systems for years, helping large and small businesses all over the world to produce and run\neffective and efficient ad campaigns that help grow their businesses. AI makes it possible to search in new languages,\nwith multiple inputs, such as using images and text at the same time with the Google App. Some of our most popular\nproducts at Google \u2014 including Lens and Translate \u2014 were built entirely using artificial intelligence technologies such\nas optical character recognition and machine learning. Google Cloud continues to build AI into numerous solutions that\nour customers can use to develop AI-powered applications \u2014 including processing documents, images, and translation\n\u2014 to understand and analyze data more efficiently, and to use packaged solutions for a variety of industries. In all\nthese examples, AI significantly enhances the usefulness and multiplies the value of these products and services to\npeople and organizations.\nOur view is that AI is now, and more than ever, critical to delivering on our mission. As we bring our breakthrough\nAI innovations into the real world to assist people and benefit society everywhere, we are also pursuing further\nadvancements that will help to unlock scientific discoveries and to tackle humanity's greatest challenges and\nopportunities.\nPrivacy and security\nWe make it a priority to protect the privacy and security of our products, users, and customers, even if there are\nnear-term financial consequences. We do this by continuously investing in building products that are secure by default;\nstrictly upholding responsible data practices that emphasize privacy by design; and building easy-to-use settings that\nput people in control. We are continually enhancing these efforts over time, whether by enabling users to auto-delete\ntheir data, giving them new tools, such as My Ad Center, to control their ad experience, or advancing anti-malware,\nanti-phishing, and password security features.\nGoogle\nFor reporting purposes Google comprises two segments: Google Services and Google Cloud.\nGoogle Services\nServing our users\nWe have always been committed to building helpful products that can improve the lives of millions of people\nworldwide. Our product innovations are what make our services widely used, and our brand one of the most\nrecognized in the world. Google Services' core products and platforms include ads, Android, Chrome, hardware,\nGmail, Google Drive, Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Play, Search, and YouTube, with broad and growing\nadoption by users around the world.\nOur products and services have come a long way since the company was founded more than two decades ago.\nRather than the ten blue links in our early search results, users can now get direct answers to their questions using\ntheir computer or mobile device, their own voice, a photo, or an image, making it quicker, easier, and more natural to\nfind what they are looking for. Of the searches we see every day, 15% are new.\nThis drive to make information more accessible and helpful has led us over the years to improve the discovery\nand creation of digital content both on the web and through platforms like Google Play and YouTube. People are\nconsuming many forms of digital content, including watching videos, playing games, listening to music, reading books,\n5"

That is why we continue\nto invest in platforms like our Android mobile operating system, Chrome browser, and Chrome operating system, as\nwell as growing our family of hardware devices. We see tremendous potential for devices to be helpful and make\npeople's lives easier by combining the best of our AI, software, and hardware. This potential is reflected in our latest\ngeneration of hardware products such as the new Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro, and the very first Pixel Watch. Creating\nproducts that people rely on every day is a journey that we are investing in for the long-term.\nHow we make money\nWe have built world-class advertising technologies for advertisers, agencies, and publishers to power their digital\nmarketing businesses. Our advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses through our wide\nrange of products across devices and formats, and we aim to ensure positive user experiences by serving the right ads\nat the right time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies.\nGoogle Services generates revenues primarily by delivering both performance and brand advertising that appears\non Google Search & other properties, YouTube, and Google Network partners' properties (\"Google Network\nproperties\"). We continue to invest in both performance and brand advertising and seek to improve the measurability of\nadvertising so advertisers understand the effectiveness of their campaigns.\n\u2022 Performance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click on leading to direct\nengagement with advertisers. Performance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while driving\nmeasurable results. Our ads tools allow performance advertisers to create simple text-based ads.\n\u2022 Brand advertising helps enhance users' awareness of and affinity for advertisers' products and services,\nthrough videos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across various devices. We help brand\nadvertisers deliver digital videos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their brand-building marketing\ncampaigns.\nWe have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web.\nWe focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways, including filtering\nout invalid traffic, removing billions of bad ads from our systems every year, and closely monitoring the sites, apps, and\nvideos where ads appear and blocklisting them when necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content.\nWe continue to focus on growing revenues beyond advertising, from Google Play, hardware, and YouTube\nsubscriptions, such as:\n\u2022 Google Play generates revenues from sales of apps and in-app purchases.\n\u2022 Hardware generates revenues from sales of Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, and Pixel\ndevices.\n\u2022 YouTube non-advertising generates subscription revenues from services such as YouTube Premium and\nYouTube TV.\nGoogle Cloud\nGoogle was a company built in the cloud, and we continue to invest in our Google Cloud offerings, including\nGoogle Cloud Platform and Google Workspace. Google Cloud Platform provides leading technology in cybersecurity;\ndata, analytics, AI, and machine learning; and infrastructure. Our cybersecurity products help customers detect,\nprotect, and respond to a broad range of cybersecurity threats. Our data cloud unifies data lakes, data warehouses,\ndata governance, and advanced machine learning into a single platform that can analyze data across any cloud. We\nprovide customers an open, reliable, and scalable infrastructure that enables them to run workloads anywhere \u2014 on\nour Cloud, at the edge, or in their data centers. Additionally, Google Workspace's easy-to-use and secure\ncommunication and collaboration tools, which include apps like Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar, Meet, and more, enable\nsecure hybrid work, boosting productivity and collaboration.\nOther Bets\nAcross Alphabet we are also using technology to try to solve big problems that affect a wide variety of industries\nfrom improving transportation and health technology to exploring solutions to address climate change. Alphabet\u2019s\ninvestment in the portfolio of Other Bets includes businesses that are at various stages of development, ranging from\nthose in the R&D phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization. Our goal is for them to become\nthriving, successful businesses. Other Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own\n6"

While these early-stage businesses naturally come with\nconsiderable uncertainty, some of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their\nindustries. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\nCompetition\nOur business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptive technologies. We face formidable\ncompetition in every aspect of our business, including, among others, from:\n\u2022 general purpose search engines and information services;\n\u2022 vertical search engines and e-commerce providers for queries related to travel, jobs, and health, which users\nmay navigate directly to rather than go through Google;\n\u2022 online advertising platforms and networks;\n\u2022 other forms of advertising, such as billboards, magazines, newspapers, radio, and television as our advertisers\ntypically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline;\n\u2022 digital content and application platform providers;\n\u2022 providers of enterprise cloud services;\n\u2022 companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that\nhave developed proprietary platforms;\n\u2022 providers of digital video services;\n\u2022 social networks, which users may rely on for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information\nthrough traditional search engines;\n\u2022 providers of workspace communication and connectivity products; and\n\u2022 digital assistant providers.\nCompeting successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and\ntechnologies to the marketplace across our businesses.

Sustainability is one of\nour core values at Google, and we strive to build sustainability into everything we do. We have been a leader on\nsustainability and climate change since Google\u2019s founding more than 20 years ago. These are some of our key\nachievements over the past two decades:\n\u2022 In 2007, we became the first major company to be carbon neutral for our operations.\n\u2022 In 2017, we became the first major company to match 100% of our annual electricity use with renewable\nenergy, which we have achieved for five consecutive years.\n\u2022 In 2020, we issued $5.75 billion in sustainability bonds\u2014the largest sustainability or green bond issuance by\nany company in history at the time. The net proceeds from the issuance were used to fund environmentally\nand socially responsible projects in the following eight areas: energy efficiency, clean energy, green buildings,\nclean transportation, circular economy and design, affordable housing, commitment to racial equity, and\nsupport for small businesses and COVID-19 crisis response. As of 2022, we had fully allocated the net\nproceeds from our sustainability bonds as outlined in our Sustainability Bond Impact Report published in 2022.\nOur sustainability strategy is focused on three key pillars: accelerating the transition to carbon-free energy and a\ncircular economy, empowering everyone with technology, and benefiting the people and places where we operate.\n7"

Reduced spending by advertisers, a\nloss of partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to customize\nads could harm our business.\nWe generated more than 80% of total revenues from online advertising in 2022. Many of our advertisers,\ncompanies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their\ncontracts with us at any time. These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value\n9"

Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practices, as well\nas changes to other companies\u2019 advertising and/or data privacy practices have in the past, and may in the future, affect\nthe advertising that we are able to provide. In addition, technologies have been developed that make customized ads\nmore difficult or that block the display of ads altogether, and some providers of online services have integrated these\ntechnologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of third-party digital advertising. Failing to\nprovide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively and competitively could harm our business, reputation,\nfinancial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions. Adverse\nmacroeconomic conditions have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in\nfluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and\noperating results.\nWe face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that\nare useful to users, customers, and other partners, we may not remain competitive, which could harm our\nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. Our businesses face changing\ntechnologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete successfully,\nwe must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful products, services,\nand technologies in a timely manner. As our businesses evolve, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a\nwider range of products and services. We must continue to invest significant resources in R&D, including through\nacquisitions, in order to enhance our technology and new and existing products and services.\nWe have many competitors in different industries. Our current and potential domestic and international\ncompetitors range from large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Some competitors have longer\noperating histories and well established relationships in various sectors. They can use their experience and resources\nin ways that could affect our competitive position, including by making acquisitions, continuing to invest heavily in R&D\nand in talent, initiating intellectual property and competition claims (whether or not meritorious), and continuing to\ncompete for users, advertisers, customers, and content providers. Further, discrepancies in enforcement of existing\nlaws may enable our lesser known competitors to aggressively interpret those laws without commensurate scrutiny,\nthereby affording them competitive advantages. Our competitors may also be able to innovate and provide products\nand services faster than we can or may foresee the need for products and services before us.\nOur financial condition and operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive to the\nevolving needs and desires of our users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. As new and\nexisting technologies continue to develop, competitors and new entrants may be able to offer experiences that are, or\nthat are seen to be, substantially similar to or better than ours. These technologies could reduce usage of our products\nand services, and force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources to develop and operate equal\nor better products and services. Competitors\u2019 success in providing compelling products and services or in attracting\nand retaining users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers could harm our financial condition and\noperating results.\nOur ongoing investment in new businesses, products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and\ncould divert management attention and harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services, and technologies. The\ninvestments that we are making across our businesses, such as in AI, reflect our ongoing efforts to innovate and\nprovide products and services that are useful to users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. Our\ninvestments span a wide range of industries beyond online advertising. Such investments ultimately may not be\ncommercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital and, in pursuing new strategies, we may incur\nunanticipated liabilities. These endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including diversion of\nresources and management attention from current operations and the use of alternative investment, governance, or\ncompensation structures that may fail to adequately align incentives across the company or otherwise accomplish their\nobjectives.\nWithin Google Services, we continue to invest heavily in hardware, including our smartphones, home devices,\nand wearables, which is a highly competitive market with frequent introduction of new products and services, rapid\nadoption of technological advancements by competitors, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards,\ncontinual improvement in performance characteristics, and price and feature sensitivity on the part of consumers and\nbusinesses. There can be no assurance we will be able to provide hardware that competes effectively.\n10"

We are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to\nsupport cloud computing services, invest in cybersecurity, and hire talent, particularly to support and scale our sales\nforce. At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services. Pricing and\ndelivery models are competitive and constantly evolving, and we may not attain sufficient scale and profitability to\nachieve our business objectives. Further, our business with public sector customers may present additional risks,\nincluding regulatory compliance risks. For instance, we may be subject to government audits and cost reviews, and\nany failure to comply or any deficiencies found may expose us to legal, financial, and/or reputational risks. Evolving\nlaws and regulations may require us to make new capital investments, build new products, and seek partners to deliver\nlocalized services in other countries, and we may not be able to meet sovereign operating requirements.\nWithin Other Bets, we are investing significantly in the areas of health, life sciences, and transportation, among\nothers. These investment areas face intense competition from large, experienced, and well-funded competitors, and\nour offerings, many of which involve the development of new and emerging technologies, may not be successful, or be\nable to compete effectively or operate at sufficient levels of profitability.\nIn addition, new and evolving products and services, including those that use AI, require significant investment\nand raise ethical, technological, legal, regulatory, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our brands and\ndemand for our products and services. Because all of these investment areas are inherently risky, no assurance can\nbe given that such strategies and offerings will be successful or will not harm our reputation, financial condition, and\noperating results.\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time, and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating\nmargin in the future.\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including changes in the\ndevices and modalities used to access our products and services; changes in geographic mix; deceleration or declines\nin advertiser spending; competition; customer usage and demand for our products; decreases in our pricing of our\nproducts and services; ongoing product and policy changes; and shifts to lower priced products and services.\nIn addition, we may also experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from a variety of\nfactors, such as the continued expansion of our business into new fields, including products and services such as\nhardware, Google Cloud, and subscription products, as well as significant investments in Other Bets, all of which may\nhave margins lower than those we generate from advertising. In particular, margins on our hardware products have\nhad, and may continue to have, an adverse affect on our consolidated margins due to pressures on pricing and higher\ncost of sales. We may also experience downward pressure on our operating margins from increasing regulations,\nincreasing competition, and increasing costs for many aspects of our business. Further, certain of our costs and\nexpenses are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. Additionally, in\nconjunction with our efforts to re-engineer costs, we may not be able to execute these efforts in a timely manner or\nthese efforts may not be successful. Due to these factors and the evolving nature of our business, our historical\nrevenue growth rate and historical operating margin may not be indicative of our future performance. For additional\ninformation, see Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect and Revenues and Monetization Metrics in Part II, Item 7\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of\nour products, services, and brands as well as affect our ability to compete.\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for\nus. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products,\nservices, and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country\nin which our products and services are distributed or made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have\ntaken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Although we seek to obtain patent protection\nfor our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Moreover, we may not have\nadequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. There is always the\npossibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or\nunenforceable.\nWe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy of such trade secrets and\nother sensitive information could be compromised, which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting\nfrom these trade secrets. We also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word\n\u201cGoogle\u201d could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word \u201csearch.\u201d Some courts have\nruled that \"Google\" is a protectable trademark, but it is possible that other courts, particularly those outside of the U.S.,\n11"

If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in\nother people using the word \u201cGoogle\u201d to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand.\nAny significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete.\nAlso, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of\nour intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our financial condition and operating\nresults.\nOur business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our\nability to expand our base of users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners.\nOur strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the\nbrands within Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch\nnew and innovative products and services that better serve the needs of our users, advertisers, customers, content\nproviders, and other partners. Our brands have been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by a number of\nfactors, including, among others, reputational issues, third-party content shared on our platforms, data privacy and\nsecurity issues and developments, and product or technical performance failures. For example, if we fail to respond\nappropriately to the sharing of misinformation or objectionable content on our services and/or products or objectionable\npractices by advertisers, or otherwise to adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence in our\nbrands.\nFurthermore, failure to maintain and enhance our brands could harm our business, reputation, financial condition,\nand operating results. Our success will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to\nprovide high-quality, trustworthy, innovative products and services that are truly useful and play a valuable role in a\nrange of settings.\nWe face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that could harm our business, financial\ncondition, and operating results.\nWe face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management, which could affect our ability\nto supply both our products and our services.\nWe rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture or assemble our hardware products and servers and\nnetworking equipment used in our technical infrastructure, and we may supply the contract manufacturers with\ncomponents to assemble the hardware products and equipment. We also rely on other companies to participate in the\ndistribution of our products and services. Our business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage these\ncompanies with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage fail to meet their\nobligations (whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons), or make adverse changes in the pricing or other\nmaterial terms of our arrangements with them.\nWe have experienced and/or may in the future experience supply shortages, price increases, and/or longer lead\ntimes that could negatively affect our operations, driven by raw material, component availability, manufacturing\ncapacity, labor shortages, industry allocations, logistics capacity, inflation, foreign currency exchange rates, tariffs,\nsanctions and export controls, trade disputes and barriers, geopolitical tensions, armed conflicts, natural disasters or\npandemics, the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant\nair quality effects and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention, and increased storm severity), power loss,\nand significant changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers. In addition, some of the components we\nuse in our technical infrastructure and our hardware products are available from only one or limited sources, and we\nmay not be able to find replacement vendors on favorable terms in the event of a supply chain disruption. A significant\nsupply interruption that affects us or our vendors could delay critical data center upgrades or expansions and delay\nconsumer product availability.\nWe may enter into long-term contracts for materials and products that commit us to significant terms and\nconditions. We may face costs for materials and products that are not consumed due to market demand, technological\nchange, changed consumer preferences, quality, product recalls, and warranty issues. For instance, because certain of\nour hardware supply contracts have volume-based pricing or minimum purchase requirements, if the volume of our\nhardware sales decreases or does not reach projected targets, we could face increased materials and manufacturing\ncosts or other financial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit to manufacture and harm our\nfinancial condition and operating results. Furthermore, certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable\ncontractual terms based on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and\nmay affect our supply.\nOur products and services have had, and in the future may have, quality issues resulting from design,\nmanufacturing, or operations. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other\n12"

Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and disaster recovery planning\ncannot account for all eventualities. The occurrence of a natural disaster or pandemic, closure of a facility, or other\nunanticipated problems affecting our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, our\nproducts and services are highly technical and complex and have contained in the past, and may contain in the future,\nerrors or vulnerabilities, which could result in interruptions in or failure of our services or systems.

Although we\nhedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S.\ndollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenues and earnings. Hedging programs are also inherently\nrisky and could expose us to additional risks that could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in the fair values of our investments and, in some instances, our financial\nstatements incorporate valuation methodologies that are subjective in nature resulting in fluctuations over\ntime.\nThe fair value of our investments may in the future be, and certain investments have been in the past, negatively\naffected by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, performance and financial results of the underlying entities, foreign\nexchange rates, changes in interest rates, including changes that may result from the implementation of new\nbenchmark rates, the effect of new or changing regulations, the stock market in general, or other factors.\nWe measure certain of our non-marketable equity and debt securities, certain other instruments including stock-\nbased compensation awards settled in the stock of certain Other Bets, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a\nbusiness combination, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The determination of fair value involves use of appropriate\nvaluation methods and certain unobservable inputs, requires management judgment and estimation, and may change\nover time. We adjust the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities to fair value for observable transactions\nof identical or similar investments of the same issuer or for impairments. All gains and losses on non-marketable equity\nsecurities, are recognized in other income (expense), which increases the volatility of our other income (expense). The\nunrealized gains and losses we record from fair value remeasurements of our non-marketable equity securities in any\nparticular period may differ significantly from the gains or losses we ultimately realize on such investments.\nAs a result of these factors, the value of our investments could decline, which could harm our financial condition\nand operating results.\nRisks Related to our Industry\nPeople access the Internet through a variety of platforms and devices that continue to evolve with the\nadvancement of technology and user preferences. If manufacturers and users do not widely adopt versions of\nour products and services developed for these interfaces, our business could be harmed.\nPeople access the Internet through a growing variety of devices such as desktop computers, mobile phones,\nsmartphones, laptops and tablets, video game consoles, voice-activated speakers, wearables, automobiles, and\ntelevision-streaming devices. Our products and services may be less popular on some interfaces. Each manufacturer\nor distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices, and our products and services may not be\navailable or may only be available with limited functionality for our users or our advertisers on these devices as a\nresult. Some manufacturers may also elect not to include our products on their devices. In addition, search queries\nmay be undertaken via voice-activated search, apps, social media or other platforms, which could harm our business.\nIt is hard to predict the challenges we may encounter in adapting our products and services and developing\ncompetitive new products and services. We expect to continue to devote significant resources to creating and\nsupporting products and services across multiple platforms and devices. Failing to attract and retain a substantial\nnumber of new device manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, developers, and users, or failing to develop products and\ntechnologies that work well on new devices and platforms, could harm our business, financial condition, and operating\nresults and ability to capture future business opportunities.\nData privacy and security concerns relating to our technology and our practices could harm our\nreputation, cause us to incur significant liability, and deter current and potential users or customers from\nusing our products and services. Computer viruses, software bugs or defects, security breaches, and attacks\non our systems could result in the improper disclosure and use of user data and interference with our users\u2019\nand customers\u2019 ability to use our products and services, harming our business and reputation.\nConcerns about, including the adequacy of, our practices with regard to the collection, use, governance,\ndisclosure, or security of personal data or other data-privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could harm our\nbusiness, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

We expect to continue to\nexperience such incidents or vulnerabilities in the future. Our efforts to address undesirable activity on our platform\nmay also increase the risk of retaliatory attack. In addition, we face the risk of cyber attacks by nation-states and state-\nsponsored actors. These attacks may target us or our customers, particularly our public sector customers (including\nfederal, state, and local governments). Geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, such as the ongoing conflict in\nUkraine, may increase these risks.\nWe may experience security issues, whether due to employee or insider error or malfeasance, system errors, or\nvulnerabilities in our or other parties\u2019 systems. While we may not determine some of these issues to be material at the\ntime they occur and may remedy them quickly, there is no guarantee that these issues will not ultimately result in\nsignificant legal, financial, and reputational harm, including government inquiries, enforcement actions, litigation, and\nnegative publicity. There is also no guarantee that a series of issues may not be determined to be material at a later\ndate in the aggregate, even if they may not be material individually at the time of their occurrence. Because the\ntechniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, disable or degrade service provided by or otherwise sabotage\nsystems change frequently and often are recognized only after being launched against a target, even taking all\nreasonable precautions, including those required by law, we have been unable in the past and may continue to be\nunable to anticipate or detect attacks or vulnerabilities or implement adequate preventative measures.\nFurther, if any partners with whom we share user or other customer information fail to implement adequate data-\nsecurity practices, fail to comply with our terms and policies, or otherwise suffer a network or other security breach, our\nusers\u2019 data may be improperly accessed, used, or disclosed. If an actual or perceived breach of our or our business\npartners\u2019 or service providers\u2019 security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures\nwould be harmed, we could lose users and customers, our trade secrets or those of our business partners may be\ncompromised, and we may be exposed to significant legal and financial risks, including legal claims (which may\ninclude class-action litigation) and regulatory actions, fines, and penalties. Any of the foregoing consequences could\nharm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWhile we have dedicated significant resources to privacy and security incident response capabilities, including\ndedicated worldwide incident response teams, our response process, particularly during times of a natural disaster or\npandemic, may not be adequate, may fail to accurately assess the severity of an incident, may not be fast enough to\nprevent or limit harm, or may fail to sufficiently remediate an incident. As a result, we may suffer significant legal,\nreputational, or financial exposure, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nFor additional information, see also our risk factor on privacy and data protection regulations under \u2018Risks Related\nto Laws, Regulations, and Policies\u2019 below.\nOur ongoing investments in safety, security, and content review will likely continue to identify abuse of\nour platforms and misuse of user data.\nIn addition to our efforts to prevent and mitigate cyber attacks, we are making significant investments in safety,\nsecurity, and review efforts to combat misuse of our services and unauthorized access to user data by third parties,\nincluding investigation and review of platform applications that could access the information of users of our services.\nAs a result of these efforts, we have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, incidents of unnecessary\naccess to or misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties. However, we may not have discovered,\nand may in the future not discover, all such incidents or activity, whether as a result of our data limitations, including\n15"

Any of the foregoing developments may negatively affect user trust and engagement, harm our reputation\nand brands, require us to change our business practices in ways that harm our business operations, and adversely\naffect our business and financial results. Any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and\nregulatory inquiries, which could result in monetary penalties and damages, divert management\u2019s time and attention,\nand lead to enhanced regulatory oversight.\nProblematic content on our platforms, including low-quality user-generated content, web spam, content\nfarms, and other violations of our guidelines could affect the quality of our services, which could harm our\nreputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services.\nWe, like others in the industry, face violations of our content guidelines across our platforms, including\nsophisticated attempts by bad actors to manipulate our hosting and advertising systems to fraudulently generate\nrevenues, or to otherwise generate traffic that does not represent genuine user interest or intent. While we invest\nsignificantly in efforts to promote high-quality and relevant results and to detect and prevent low-quality content and\ninvalid traffic, we have been unable and may continue to be unable to detect and prevent all such abuses or promote\nuniformly high-quality content.\nMany websites violate or attempt to violate our guidelines, including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in\nsearch results than our search engine's assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them. Such efforts have\naffected, and may continue to affect, the quality of content on our platforms and lead them to display false, misleading,\nor undesirable content. Although English-language web spam in our search results has been reduced, and web spam\nin most other languages is limited, we expect web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improve their\nrankings. We continuously combat web spam in our search results, including through indexing technology that makes it\nharder for spam-like, less useful web content to rank highly. We also continue to invest in and deploy proprietary\ntechnology to detect and prevent web spam on our platforms. We also face other challenges from low-quality and\nirrelevant content websites, including content farms, which are websites that generate large quantities of low-quality\ncontent to help them improve their search rankings. We are continually launching algorithmic changes designed to\ndetect and prevent abuse from low-quality websites. We also face other challenges on our platforms, including\nviolations of our content guidelines involving incidents such as attempted election interference, activities that threaten\nthe safety and/or well-being of our users on- or off-line, and the spreading of misinformation or disinformation.\nIf we fail to either detect and prevent an increase in problematic content or effectively promote high-quality\ncontent, it could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information or reduce use of our platforms, harming our\nfinancial condition and operating results. It may also subject us to litigation and regulatory actions, which could result in\nmonetary penalties and damages and divert management\u2019s time and attention.\nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users. Internet\naccess providers may be able to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and\nservices, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers.\nOur products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet, and certain of our products\nrequire significant bandwidth to work effectively. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant\nmarket power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable\ncompanies, mobile communications companies, and government-owned service providers. Some of these providers\nhave taken, or have stated that they may take, measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user\naccess to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our\nofferings, by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings, or by providing our competitors\npreferential access. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by internet\naccess providers; however, substantial uncertainty exists in the U.S. and elsewhere regarding such protections.

In\naddition, in some jurisdictions, our products and services have been subject to government-initiated restrictions or\nblockages. These could harm existing key relationships, including with our users, customers, advertisers, and/or\ncontent providers, and impair our ability to attract new ones; harm our reputation; and increase costs, thereby\nnegatively affecting our business.\nRisks Related to Laws, Regulations, and Policies\nWe are subject to a variety of new, existing, and changing laws and regulations worldwide that could\nharm our business, and will likely be subject to an even broader scope of laws and regulations as we continue\nto expand our business.\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subjects, and our\nintroduction of new businesses, products, services, and technologies will likely continue to subject us to additional laws\nand regulations. In recent years, governments around the world have proposed and adopted a large number of new\nlaws and regulations relevant to the digital economy, particularly in the areas of data privacy and security, competition,\nand online content. The costs of compliance with these measures are high and are likely to increase in the future.\nNew or changing laws and regulations, or new interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a\nmanner inconsistent with our practices, have resulted in, and may continue to result in, less useful products and\nservices, altered business practices, limited ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products and\nservices, substantial costs, and civil or criminal liability. Examples include laws and regulations regarding:\n\u2022 Competition and technology platforms\u2019 business practices: Laws and regulations focused on large\ntechnology platforms, including the Digital Markets Act in the European Union (EU); regulations in South Korea\nand elsewhere that affect Google Play\u2019s billing policies, fees, and business model; as well as regulations under\nconsideration in a range of jurisdictions.\n\u2022 Data privacy, collection, and processing: Laws and regulations further restricting the collection, processing,\nand/or sharing of user or advertising-related data, including privacy and data protection laws, laws affecting the\nprocessing of children's data (as discussed further below), data breach notification laws, and laws limiting data\ntransfers (including data localization laws).\n\u2022 Copyright and other intellectual property: Copyright and related laws, including the EU Directive on\nCopyright in the Digital Single Market and European Economic Area transpositions, which may introduce new\nlicensing regimes, increase liability with respect to content uploaded by users or linked to from our platforms,\nor create property rights in news publications that could require payments to news agencies and publishers.\n\u2022 Content moderation: Various laws covering content moderation and removal, and related disclosure\nobligations, such as the EU's Digital Services Act, Florida\u2019s Senate Bill 7072 and Texas\u2019 House Bill 20, and\nlaws and proposed legislation in Singapore, Australia, and the United Kingdom that impose penalties for failure\nto remove certain types of content or require disclosure of information about the operation of our services and\nalgorithms, which may make it harder for services like Google Search and YouTube to detect and deal with\nlow-quality, deceptive, or harmful content.\n\u2022 Consumer protection: Consumer protection laws, including the EU\u2019s New Deal for Consumers, which could\nresult in monetary penalties and create a range of new compliance obligations.\nIn addition, the applicability and scope of these and other laws and regulations, as interpreted by the courts,\nremain uncertain and could be interpreted in ways that harm our business. For example, we rely on statutory safe\nharbors, like those set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Section 230 of the Communications Decency\nAct in the U.S. and the E-Commerce Directive in Europe, to protect against liability for various linking, caching, ranking,\nrecommending, and hosting activities. Legislation or court rulings affecting these safe harbors may adversely affect us\nand may impose significant operational challenges. There are legislative proposals and pending litigation in the U.S.\n(such as Gonzalez v. Google), EU, and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for\nwebsites and online platforms.\nWe are and may continue to be subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations,\nenforcement actions, consent orders, and other forms of regulatory scrutiny and legal liability that could harm\nour business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent\norders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and\nemployment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or\npublishers using our platforms, personal injury, and other matters.

Claims have been brought, and we expect will continue to be brought, against\nus for defamation, negligence, breaches of contract, copyright and trademark infringement, unfair competition, unlawful\nactivity, torts, privacy rights violations, fraud, or other legal theories based on the nature and content of information\navailable on or via our services or due to our involvement in hosting, transmitting, marketing, branding, or providing\naccess to content created by third parties.\nFor example, the U.S. Department of Justice, various U.S. states, and other plaintiffs have filed several antitrust\nlawsuits about various aspects of our business, including our advertising technologies and practices, the operation and\ndistribution of Google Search, and the operation and distribution of the Android operating system and Play Store. Other\nregulatory agencies in the U.S. and around the world, including competition enforcers, consumer protection agencies,\nand data protection authorities, have challenged and may continue to challenge our business practices and\ncompliance with laws and regulations. We are cooperating with these investigations and defending litigation where\nappropriate. Various laws, regulations, investigations, enforcement lawsuits, and regulatory actions have in the past,\nand may in the future result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing\nobligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral\nrelated civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial\ncondition, and operating results.\nAny of these legal proceedings could result in legal costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity\nand other harms to our business. Estimating liabilities for our pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that\nrequires significant judgment, and the amounts we are ultimately liable for may exceed our estimates. The resolution of\none or more such proceedings has resulted in, and may in the future result in, additional substantial fines, penalties,\ninjunctions, and other sanctions that could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nPrivacy, data protection, and data usage regulations are complex and rapidly evolving areas. Any failure\nor alleged failure to comply with these laws could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and\noperating results.\nAuthorities around the world have adopted and are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals\nconcerning data protection, data usage, and encryption of user data. Adverse legal rulings, legislation, or regulation\nhave resulted in, and may continue to result in, fines and orders requiring that we change our practices, which have\nhad and could continue to have an adverse effect on how we provide services, harming our business, reputation,\nfinancial condition, and operating results. These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and\ncompliance obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs or harm the quality and operations of our products\nand services in ways that harm our business. Examples of these laws include:\n\u2022 The General Data Protection Regulation and the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulations, which\napply to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or the United Kingdom, respectively, or\nrelated to products and services that we offer to EU or the United Kingdom users or customers, respectively, or\nthe monitoring of their behavior in the EU or the UK, respectively.\n\u2022 Various state and foreign privacy laws and regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018,\nthe California Privacy Rights Act, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, the Colorado Privacy Act, the\nConnecticut Data Privacy Act, and the Utah Consumer Privacy Act, all of which give new data privacy rights to\ntheir respective residents (including, in California, a private right of action in the event of a data breach\nresulting from our failure to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices) and\nimpose significant obligations on controllers and processors of consumer data.\n\u2022 State laws governing the processing of biometric information, such as the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy\nAct and the Texas Capture or Use of Biometric Identifier Act, which impose obligations on businesses that\ncollect or disclose consumer biometric information.\n\u2022 Various federal, state, and foreign laws governing how companies provide age appropriate experiences to\nchildren and minors, including the collection and processing of children and minor\u2019s data. These include the\nChildren\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, the United Kingdom Age-Appropriate Design Code, and the\nCalifornia Age Appropriate Design Code, all of which address the use and disclosure of the personal data of\nchildren and minors and impose obligations on online services or products directed to or likely to be accessed\nby children.\n\u2022 The California Internet of Things Security Law, which regulates the security of data used in connection with\ninternet-connected devices.\n18"

Previously available transfer mechanisms, such as the EU-U.S.\nand the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks, were invalidated in 2020, and other bases for data transfer and\nstorage, such as Standard Contractual Clauses, remain subject to ongoing review in ways that may require us to adapt\nour existing contractual arrangements. The validity of various data transfer mechanisms remains subject to legal,\nregulatory, and political developments in both Europe and the U.S., including the potential adoption of the U.S.-EU\nData Privacy Framework. Until the U.S.-EU Data Privacy Framework is adopted by the EU, the legal uncertainty and\nongoing enforcement action from supervisory authorities related to cross-border transfers of personal data, could harm\nour ability to process and transfer personal data outside of the European Economic Area and could in turn harm our\nability to provide, and our customers\u2019 ability to use, some of our products and services.\nWe face, and may continue to face, intellectual property and other claims that could be costly to defend,\nresult in significant damage awards or other costs (including indemnification awards), and limit our ability to\nuse certain technologies.\nWe, like other internet, technology, and media companies, are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations\nof infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights, including patent, copyright, trade secrets, and\ntrademarks. Parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in U.S. and international courts\nand the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) for exclusion and cease-and-desist orders. In addition, patent-\nholding companies may frequently seek to generate income from patents they have obtained by bringing claims\nagainst us. As we continue to expand our business, the number of intellectual property claims against us has increased\nand may continue to increase as we develop and acquire new products, services, and technologies.\nAdverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing\nagreements (if licenses are available at all), or orders limiting our ability to sell our products and services in the U.S. or\nelsewhere, including by preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services in certain\njurisdictions. They may also cause us to change our business practices in ways that could result in a loss of revenues\nfor us and otherwise harm our business.\nMany of our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require us to defend\nagainst certain intellectual property infringement claims and in some cases indemnify them for certain intellectual\nproperty infringement claims against them, which could result in increased costs for defending such claims or\nsignificant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Such customers and partners may also\ndiscontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could\nresult in loss of revenues and harm our business. Moreover, intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our\nsuppliers, when obtainable, may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers arising from\nintellectual property infringement claims. Furthermore, in connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in\nthe future agree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, including those associated with intellectual\nproperty claims. Regardless of their merits, intellectual property claims are often time consuming and expensive to\nlitigate or settle. To the extent such claims are successful, they could harm our business, including our product and\nservice offerings, financial condition, and operating results.\nExpectations relating to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations could expose us to\npotential liabilities, increased costs, and reputational harm.\nWe are subject to laws, regulations, and other measures that govern a wide range of topics, including those\nrelated to matters beyond our core products and services. For instance, new laws, regulations, policies, and\ninternational accords relating to ESG matters, including sustainability, climate change, human capital, and diversity, are\nbeing developed and formalized in Europe, the U.S., and elsewhere, which may entail specific, target-driven\nframeworks and/or disclosure requirements. We have implemented robust ESG programs, adopted reporting\nframeworks and principles, and announced a number of goals and initiatives. The implementation of these goals and\ninitiatives may require considerable investments, and our goals, with all of their contingencies, dependencies, and in\ncertain cases, reliance on third-party verification and/or performance, are complex and ambitious, may change, and we\ncannot guarantee that we will achieve them. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to adhere to our public statements,\ncomply fully with developing interpretations of ESG laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder\nexpectations and standards could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or\nexposure to additional tax liabilities.\n19"

Further, if we are\nunable or fail to collect taxes on behalf of customers, employees and partners as the withholding agent, we could\nbecome liable for taxes that are levied against third parties.\nWe are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. As a result, we have\nreceived, and may in the future receive, assessments in multiple jurisdictions, on various tax-related assertions, such\nas transfer-pricing adjustments or permanent-establishment claims. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit\ncould harm our financial condition and operating results, require adverse changes to our business practices, or subject\nus to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income\ntaxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and often involves uncertainty. Although we believe our\nestimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements\nand may affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nFurthermore, due to shifting economic and political conditions, tax policies, laws, or rates in various jurisdictions\nmay be subject to significant changes in ways that could harm our financial condition and operating results. Various\njurisdictions around the world have enacted or are considering revenue-based taxes such as digital services taxes and\nother targeted taxes, which could lead to inconsistent and potentially overlapping international tax regimes. The\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing\ninternational tax rules.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Stock\nWe cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program will be fully consummated or will enhance long-\nterm stockholder value, and share repurchases could increase the volatility of our stock prices and could\ndiminish our cash reserves.\nWe engage in share repurchases of our Class A and Class C stock from time to time in accordance with\nauthorizations from the Board of Directors of Alphabet. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and\ndoes not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares.\nFurther, our share repurchases could affect our share trading prices, increase their volatility, reduce our cash reserves\nand may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock.\nThe concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B stock has 10 votes per share, our Class A stock has one vote per share, and our Class C stock has\nno voting rights. As of December 31, 2022, Larry Page and Sergey Brin beneficially owned approximately 85.8% of our\noutstanding Class B stock, which represented approximately 51.2% of the voting power of our outstanding common\nstock. Through their stock ownership, Larry and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring\nstockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or\nother sale of our company or our assets, for the foreseeable future. In addition, because our Class C stock carries no\nvoting rights (except as required by applicable law), the issuance of the Class C stock, including in future stock-based\nacquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs, could continue Larry and Sergey\u2019s current\nrelative voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters\nsubmitted to a vote of our stockholders. The share repurchases made pursuant to our repurchase program may also\naffect Larry and Sergey\u2019s relative voting power. This concentrated control limits or severely restricts other stockholders\u2019\nability to influence corporate matters and we may take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial,\nwhich could reduce the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C stock.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that\nstockholders may consider favorable.\nProvisions in Alphabet\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a\nchange of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022 Our Board of Directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of\nDirectors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director.\n\u2022 Our stockholders may not act by written consent, which makes it difficult to take certain actions without holding\na stockholders' meeting.\n20"

These broad market and industry factors could harm the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C\nstock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nGeneral Risks\nThe continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact are highly unpredictable and could be\nsignificant, and could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur business, operations and financial performance have been, and may continue to be, affected by the\nmacroeconomic impacts resulting from COVID-19, and as a result, our revenue growth rate and expenses as a\npercentage of our revenues in future periods may differ significantly from our historical rates, and our future operating\nresults may fall below expectations. The extent to which our business will continue to be affected will depend on a\nvariety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including the persistence of the pandemic, impacts on\neconomic activity, and the possibility of recession or continued financial market instability.\nOur operating results may fluctuate, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our\nresults to fall short of expectations.\nOur operating results have fluctuated, and may in the future fluctuate, as a result of a number of factors, many\noutside of our control, including the cyclicality and seasonality in our business and geopolitical events. As a result,\ncomparing our operating results (including our expenses as a percentage of our revenues) on a period-to-period basis\nmay not be meaningful, and our past results should not be relied on as an indication of our future performance.\nConsequently, our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations.\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures could result in operating difficulties, dilution,\nand other consequences that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures are important elements of our overall corporate strategy\nand use of capital, and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and operating results. We expect\nto continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of such potential strategic transactions, which\ncould create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Some of the areas where we face risks include:\n\u2022 diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and\nother strategic transactions;\n\u2022 failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities, or conditions\nplaced upon approval that could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or\notherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of a transaction;\n\u2022 failure to successfully integrate the acquired operations, technologies, services, and personnel (including\ncultural integration and retention of employees) and further develop the acquired business or technology;\n\u2022 implementation or remediation of controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company;\n21"

Also, the\nanticipated benefits or value of our acquisitions and other strategic transactions may not materialize.

Our ability to compete\neffectively and our future success depends on our continuing to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly\nskilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense, and\ncertain of our competitors have directly targeted, and may continue to target, our employees. In addition, our\ncompensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be successful in attracting new\nemployees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Restrictive immigration policy and regulatory changes\nmay also affect our ability to hire, mobilize, or retain some of our global talent.\nIn addition, we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. As our organization\ngrows and evolves, we may need to implement more complex organizational management structures or adapt our\ncorporate culture and work environments to ever-changing circumstances, such as during times of a natural disaster or\npandemic, and these changes could affect our ability to compete effectively or have an adverse effect on our corporate\nculture. As we experiment with hybrid work models, we may experience increased costs and/or disruption, in addition\nto potential effects on our ability to operate effectively and maintain our corporate culture.\nITEM 1B.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nPlease read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with\n\u201cNote about Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d Part I, Item 1 \"Business,\" Part I, Item 1A \"Risk Factors,\" and our\nconsolidated financial statements and related notes included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe have omitted discussion of 2020 results where it would be redundant to the discussion previously included in\nItem 7 of our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nUnderstanding Alphabet\u2019s Financial Results\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses \u2014 the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments,\nGoogle Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For further\ndetails on our segments, see Part I, Item 1 \u201cBusiness\u201d and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTrends in Our Business and Financial Effect\nThe following long-term trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate\nthat they will continue to affect our future results:\n\u2022 Users' behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves.\nThe continuing shift from an offline to online world has contributed to the growth of our business and our revenues\nsince inception. We expect that this shift to an online world will continue to benefit our business and our revenues,\nalthough at a slower pace than we have experienced historically, in particular after the outsized growth in our\nadvertising revenues during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we face increasing competition for user engagement\nand advertisers, which may affect our revenues.\n\u2022 Users continue to access our products and services using diverse devices and modalities, which\nallows for new advertising formats that may benefit our revenues but adversely affect our margins.\nOur users are accessing the Internet via diverse devices and modalities, such as smartphones, wearables, and\nsmart home devices, and want to be able to be connected no matter where they are or what they are doing. We are\nfocused on expanding our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to maintain and grow our\nbusiness.\nWe benefit from advertising revenues generated from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising\nformats. The margins from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional\ndesktop search. Additionally, as the market for a particular device type or modality matures, our advertising revenues\nmay be affected. For example, growth in the global smartphone market has slowed due to various factors, including\nincreased market saturation in developed countries, which can affect our mobile advertising revenues.\nWe expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our revenues grow\nand TAC as a percentage of our advertising revenues (\"TAC rate\") to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic\nmix; partner mix; partner agreement terms; the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points; product\nmix; the relative revenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels; and revenue share terms.\nWe expect these trends to continue to affect our revenues and put pressure on our margins.\n\u2022 As online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings, which may affect our\nmonetization.\nAs interactions between users and advertisers change, and as online user behavior evolves, we continue to\nexpand our product offerings to serve these changing needs, which may affect our monetization. For example,\nrevenues from ads on YouTube and Google Play monetize at a lower rate than our traditional search ads. We also may\ndevelop new products incorporating AI innovations that could affect our monetization trends. Additionally, when\ndeveloping new products and services we generally focus first on user experience before prioritizing monetization.\n\u2022 As users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets\ncontinue to increase, and may require continued investments. In addition, movements in foreign exchange\nrates affect such revenues.\nThe shift to online, as well as the advent of the multi-device world, has brought opportunities outside of the U.S.,\nincluding in emerging markets, such as India. We continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our\nproducts and advertising programs relevant to our users in these markets. This has led to a trend of increased\n26"

We expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these\nmarkets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available. This trend could affect our revenues as\ndeveloping markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets.\nInternational revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a foreign exchange risk management program\ndesigned to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues\nand earnings.\n\u2022 The revenues that we derive from non-advertising products and services are increasing and may\nadversely affect our margins.\nNon-advertising revenues have grown over time, and we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding\nour products and services. The margins on these revenues vary significantly and are generally lower than the margins\non our advertising revenues. In particular margins on our hardware products adversely affect our consolidated margins\ndue to pressures on pricing and higher cost of sales.\n\u2022 As we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and\ncapital expenditures.\nWe continue to make significant research and development investments in areas of strategic focus as we seek to\ndevelop new, innovative offerings and improve our existing offerings across our businesses. We also expect to\ncontinue to invest in our technical infrastructure, including servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support\nthe growth of our business and our long-term initiatives, in particular in support of AI. In addition acquisitions and\nstrategic investments contribute to the breadth and depth of our offerings, expand our expertise in engineering and\nother functional areas, and build strong partnerships around strategic initiatives. For example, in September 2022 we\nclosed the acquisition of Mandiant to help expand our offerings in dynamic cyber defense and response.\n\u2022 We face continuing changes in regulatory conditions, laws, and public policies, which could affect our\nbusiness practices and financial results.\nChanges in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide\nrange of topics and related legal matters have resulted in fines and caused us to change our business practices. As\nthese global trends continue, our cost of doing business may increase, our ability to pursue certain business models or\noffer certain products or services may be limited, and we may need to change our business practices. Examples\ninclude the antitrust complaints filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and a number of state Attorneys General;\npending litigation in the U.S., EU, and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for\nwebsites and online platforms; and the Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act in Europe and various legislative\nproposals in the U.S. focused on large technology platforms. For additional information see Item 1A Risk Factors and\nLegal Matters in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8.\n\u2022 Our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them.\nOur employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. We expect to continue\nhiring talented employees around the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs. For additional\ninformation see Culture and Workforce in Part I, Item 1 \u201cBusiness.\u201d\nRevenues and Monetization Metrics\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide\nenterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration\ntools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for\nsubscription-based products. For details on how we recognize revenue, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition to the long-term trends and their financial effect on our business noted above, fluctuations in our\nrevenues have been and may continue to be affected by a combination of factors, including:\n\u2022 changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022 changes in pricing, such as those resulting from changes in fee structures, discounts, and customer incentives;\n\u2022 general economic conditions and various external dynamics, including geopolitical events, regulations, and\nother measures and their effect on advertiser, consumer, and enterprise spending;\n\u2022 new product and service launches; and\n27"

We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP\npercentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for financial\nand operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the\npresentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles\n(GAAP) results helps improve the ability to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign\ncurrency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant\nperiod over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate\nmovements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We use constant\ncurrency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year basis. Constant\ncurrency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable period exchange\nrates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.\n33"

The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using\ncertain market rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals. No amounts have\nbeen borrowed under the credit facilities.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with a total carrying value of $12.9 billion\nwith short-term and long-term future interest payments of $231 million and $3.8 billion, respectively. See Note 6 of the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further\ninformation on our debt.\nWe primarily utilize contract manufacturers for the assembly of our servers used in our technical infrastructure\nand hardware products we sell. We have agreements where we may purchase components directly from suppliers and\nthen supply these components to contract manufacturers for use in the assembly of the servers and hardware\nproducts. Certain of these arrangements result in a portion of the cash received from and paid to the contract\nmanufacturers to be presented as financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in Item 8\nof this Annual Report on From 10-K.\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn April 2022, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $70.0 billion of its\nClass A and Class C shares. As of December 31, 2022, $28.1 billion remains available for Class A and Class C share\nrepurchases. In accordance with the authorization of the Board of Directors of Alphabet, during 2022 we repurchased\nand subsequently retired 530 million shares for $59.3 billion. Of the aggregate amount repurchased and subsequently\nretired, 61 million shares were Class A stock for $6.7 billion and 469 million shares were Class C stock for $52.6 billion.\nSee Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEuropean Commission Fines\nIn 2017, 2018 and 2019, the EC announced decisions that certain actions taken by Google infringed European\ncompetition law and imposed fines of \u20ac2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017), \u20ac4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of\nJune 30, 2018), and \u20ac1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019), respectively. On September 14, 2022, the General\nCourt reduced the 2018 fine from \u20ac4.3 billion to \u20ac4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal to the European Court of\nJustice. In 2018 we recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in 2022.\nWhile each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities\non our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines.

As\npermitted by the Tax Act, we will pay the transition tax in annual interest-free installments through 2025. We also have\ntaxes payable of $5.1 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2022.\nPurchase Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had material non-cancelable contractual obligations of $32.0 billion, of which $17.3\nbillion was short-term. These amounts represent the non-cancelable portion of agreements or the minimum\ncancellation fee and are primarily related to commitments to purchase licenses, technical infrastructure, inventory, and\nnetwork capacity. For those agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond\nany minimum quantities and/or pricing as of December 31, 2022.\nIn addition we regularly enter into multi-year, non-cancellable agreements to purchase renewable energy and\nenergy attributes, such as renewable energy certificates. These agreements do not include a minimum dollar\ncommitment. The amounts to be paid under these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated and\nare not readily determinable.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In doing so, we have to make\nestimates and assumptions. Our critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of\nuncertainty at the time the estimate was made, and changes in them have had or are reasonably likely to have a\nmaterial effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from\nour estimates. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable\nunder the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We have reviewed our critical\naccounting estimates with the Audit and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors.\nSee Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form\n10-K for a summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements.\nFair Value Measurements of Non-Marketable Equity Securities\nWe measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, consisting primarily of our non-\nmarketable equity securities. These investments are accounted for under the measurement alternative method (\"the\nmeasurement alternative\") and are measured at cost, less impairment, subject to upward and downward adjustments\nresulting from observable price changes for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. These adjustments\nrequire quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities, which may require the use of unobservable inputs.\nPricing adjustments are determined by using various valuation methodologies and involve the use of estimates using\nthe best information available, which may include cash flow projections or other available market data.\nNon-marketable equity securities are also evaluated for impairment, based on qualitative factors including the\ncompanies' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among others. When indicators of\nimpairment exist, we prepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market\napproach or an income approach, which requires judgment and the use of unobservable inputs, including discount\nrates, investee revenues and costs, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others.\nWhen the quantitative remeasurements of fair value indicate an impairment exists, we write down the investment to its\ncurrent fair value.\nWe also have compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain investments, i.e.\nperformance fees. We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may\nresult in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use\nof unobservable inputs.\nProperty and Equipment\nWe assess the reasonableness of the useful lives of our property and equipment periodically as well as when\nother changes occur, such as when there are changes to ongoing business operations, changes in the planned use\nand utilization of assets, or technological advancements, that could indicate a change in the period over which we\nexpect to benefit from the assets.\n39"

            "text": "Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating\nour uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.\nRecording an uncertain tax position involves various qualitative considerations, including evaluation of\ncomparable and resolved tax exposures, applicability of tax laws, and likelihood of settlement. We evaluate uncertain\ntax positions periodically, considering changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial\nopinions, as well as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities. Although we believe we have adequately\nreserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not\nbe different. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such\ndifferences will affect the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination\nis made.\nThe provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are\nconsidered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties. In addition, we are subject to the continuous\nexamination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Services (IRS) and other tax authorities which may\nassert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these\nexaminations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and\nconsent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor\nand employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or\npublishers using our platforms, personal injury consumer protection, and other matters. Certain of these matters\ninclude speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe\nthat it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a\nloss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in Note 10 of\nthe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that\nhas been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make\nadjustments and changes to our disclosures as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both the\nlikelihood and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters. Until the final resolution of such matters, there\nmay be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material.\nChange in Accounting Estimate\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment, resulting\nin a change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment to six years, which we expect to\nresult in a reduction of depreciation of approximately $3.4 billion for the full fiscal year 2023 for assets in service as of\nDecember 31, 2022, recorded primarily in cost of revenues and R&D expenses. See Note 1 of the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information relating to the\nuseful lives of our servers and network equipment.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates,\nand equity investment risks.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. International revenues, as well as costs and expenses\ndenominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the\nU.S. dollar. Principal currencies hedged included the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro, and\nJapanese yen. For the purpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk, we considered the historical trends in\nforeign currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange\nrates of 10% could be experienced.\nWe use foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on assets and liabilities\ndenominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. These forward and option contracts\nreduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and\nliabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on these assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense),\nnet, which are offset by the gains and losses on the forward and option contracts.\n40"

            "text": "Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\nIf an adverse 10% foreign currency exchange rate change was applied to total monetary assets, liabilities, and\ncommitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies at the balance sheet date, it would have\nresulted in an adverse effect on income before income taxes of approximately $285 million and $136 million as of\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively, after consideration of the effect of foreign exchange contracts in place for\nthe years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022.\nWe use foreign currency forward and option contracts, including collars (an option strategy comprised of a\ncombination of purchased and written options) to protect forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from changes in\nforeign currency exchange rates. When the U.S. dollar strengthens, gains from foreign currency forward and option\ncontacts reduce the foreign currency losses related to our earnings. When the U.S. dollar weakens, losses from foreign\ncurrency forward and option contracts offset the foreign currency gains related to our earnings. These hedging\ncontracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We designate\nthese contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. We reflect the gains or losses of foreign currency spot\nrate changes as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and subsequently reclassify them\ninto revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur.\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10% as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, the amount recorded in AOCI related to\nour cash flow hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $1.3 billion lower for both December 31, 2021\nand 2022. The change in the value recorded in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency\nchange in forecasted hedged revenues when recognized.\nWe use foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency\nrisks related to investment in foreign subsidiaries. These forward contracts serve to offset the foreign currency\ntranslation risk from our foreign operations.\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10%, the amount recorded in cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) within AOCI\nrelated to our net investment hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $975 million and $903 million\nlower as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. The change in value recorded in CTA would be expected to\noffset a corresponding foreign currency translation gain or loss from our investment in foreign subsidiaries.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur Corporate Treasury investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and\nmaintain liquidity. We invest primarily in debt securities, including government bonds, corporate debt securities,\nmortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, money market and other funds, time deposits, and interest rate\nderivatives. By policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and\nfloating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair\nmarket value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income\nthan predicted if interest rates fall. Unrealized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to\ninterest rate fluctuations as compared to interest rates at the time of purchase. For certain fixed and variable rate debt\nsecurities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in other income\n(expense), net. We measure securities for which we have not elected the fair value option at fair value with gains and\nlosses recorded in AOCI until the securities are sold, less any expected credit losses.\nWe use value-at-risk (VaR) analysis to determine the potential effect of fluctuations in interest rates on the value\nof our marketable debt security portfolio. The VaR is the expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, for\nour investment portfolio due to adverse movements in interest rates. We use a variance/covariance VaR model with\n95% confidence interval. The estimated one-day loss in fair value of marketable debt securities as of December 31,\n2021 and 2022 are shown below (in millions):\n12-Month Average\nAs of December 31, As of December 31,\n2021 2022 2021 2022\nRisk category - interest rate $ 139 $ 256 $ 148 $ 198\nActual future gains and losses associated with our marketable debt security portfolio may differ materially from the\nsensitivity analyses performed as of December 31, 2021 and 2022 due to the inherent limitations associated with\npredicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates and our actual exposures and positions. VaR analysis is\nnot intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation.\nEquity Investment Risk\nOur marketable and non-marketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that\ncould substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings.\n41"

A\nhypothetical adverse price change of 10% on our December 31, 2022 balance would decrease the fair value of\nmarketable equity securities by $516 million. From time to time, we may enter into derivatives to hedge the market\nprice risk on certain of our marketable equity securities.\nOur non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are adjusted to fair value for\nobservable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the\nmeasurement alternative). The fair value measured at the time of the observable transaction is not necessarily an\nindication of the current fair value as of the balance sheet date. These investments, especially those that are in the\nearly stages, are inherently risky because the technologies or products these companies have under development are\ntypically in the early phases and may never materialize, and they may experience a decline in financial condition,\nwhich could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. Valuations of our equity\ninvestments in private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data and\nobservable transactions at lower valuations could result in significant losses. In addition, global economic conditions\ncould result in additional volatility. The success of our investment in any private company is also typically dependent on\nthe likelihood of our ability to realize appreciation in the value of investments through liquidity events such as public\nofferings, acquisitions, private sales or other market events. Changes in the valuation of non-marketable equity\nsecurities may not directly correlate with changes in valuation of marketable equity securities. As of December 31,\n2021 and 2022, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities, which were accounted for under the\nmeasurement alternative, was $27.6 billion and $28.5 billion, respectively.\nThe carrying values of our equity method investments, which totaled approximately $1.5 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2022, generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes.

            "text": "Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\nAlphabet Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August\n2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became\nthe successor issuer to Google.\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide\nenterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales\nof other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-\nbased products.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated\nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes.\nActual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our\nestimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; fair values of financial instruments, intangible\nassets, and goodwill; inventory; useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment; income taxes; and\ncontingent liabilities, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that\nare believed to be reasonable, and the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values\nof assets and liabilities.\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and\nadjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain\nnetwork equipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate is effective beginning in fiscal year\n2023.\nStock Split Effected in the Form of a Stock Dividend (\u201cStock Split\u201d)\nOn February 1, 2022, the company announced that the Board of Directors had approved and declared a 20-for-\none stock split in the form of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the company\u2019s Class A, Class B, and\nClass C stock. The Stock Split had a record date of July 1, 2022 and an effective date of July 15, 2022. The par value\nper share of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock remains unchanged at $0.001 per share after the Stock Split. All\nprior period references made to share or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements\nand applicable disclosures prior to the effective date have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock\nSplit.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, and\nthe collectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or services is probable. Sales and other\nsimilar taxes are excluded from revenues.\nAdvertising Revenues\nWe generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on:\n\u2022 Google Search and other properties, including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners\nwho use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated\nproperties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n\u2022 YouTube properties; and\n\u2022 Google Network properties, including revenues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob,\nAdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\nOur customers generally purchase advertising inventory through Google Ads, Google Ad Manager, and Google\nMarketing Platform, among others.\n52"

We recognize revenues for\nperformance advertising when a user engages with the advertisement, such as a click, a view, or a purchase. For\nbrand advertising, we recognize revenues when the ad is displayed, or a user views the ad.\nFor ads placed on Google Network properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on\na gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed\non Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues,\nand amounts paid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of revenues. Where we are the principal, we\ncontrol the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to\nmonetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being\nprimarily responsible to our customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing.\nGoogle Cloud Revenues\nGoogle Cloud revenues consist of revenues from:\n\u2022 Google Cloud Platform, which includes fees for infrastructure, platform, and other services;\n\u2022 Google Workspace, which includes fees for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for\nenterprises, such as Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar, and Meet; and\n\u2022 other enterprise services.\nOur cloud services are generally provided on either a consumption or subscription basis and may have contract\nterms longer than a year. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis are recognized when\nthe customer utilizes the services, based on the quantity of services consumed. Revenues related to cloud services\nprovided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer receives and\nconsumes the benefits of the cloud services.\nGoogle Other Revenues\nGoogle other revenues consist of revenues from:\n\u2022 Google Play, which includes sales of apps and in-app purchases;\n\u2022 hardware, which includes sales of Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, and Pixel devices;\n\u2022 YouTube non-advertising, which includes subscription revenues from services such as YouTube Premium and\nYouTube TV; and\n\u2022 other products and services.\nWe report revenues from Google Play app sales and in-app purchases on a net basis, because our performance\nobligation is to facilitate a transaction between app developers and end users, for which we earn a service fee.\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate\nrevenues to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine\nstandalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers.\nCustomer Incentives and Credits\nCertain customers receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration.\nWe estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues. We\nbelieve that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration.\nSales Commissions\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred when the amortization period (the period of the expected benefit)\nis one year or less. We recognize an asset for certain sales commissions if we expect the period of benefit of these\ncosts to exceed one year and recognize the expense over the amortization period. These costs are recorded within\nsales and marketing expenses.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues consists of TAC and other costs of revenues.\n\u2022 TAC includes:\n53"

As a result, development costs\nthat meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented.\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and\ncloud-based applications used to deliver our services. We capitalize development costs related to these software\napplications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the\nsoftware will be used to perform the function intended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications\nwere not material for the periods presented.\nStock-based Compensation\nStock-based compensation primarily consists of Alphabet restricted stock units (RSUs). RSUs are equity\nclassified and measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. We recognize RSU expense\nusing the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur.\nFor RSUs, shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory income tax withholding to be\npaid by us on behalf of our employees. As a result, fewer shares are issued than the number of RSUs outstanding, and\nthe income tax withholding is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.\nAdditionally, stock-based compensation includes other stock-based awards, such as performance stock units\n(PSUs) that include market conditions and awards that may be settled in cash or the stock of certain Other Bets. PSUs\nand certain Other Bet awards are equity classified and expense is recognized over the requisite service period. Certain\nOther Bet awards are liability classified and remeasured at fair value through settlement. The fair value of Other Bet\nawards is based on the equity valuation of the respective Other Bet.\nAdvertising and Promotional Expenses\nWe expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred. For the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $5.4 billion, $7.9\nbillion, and $9.2 billion, respectively.\nPerformance Fees\nPerformance fees refer to compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain\ninvestments. We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may\nresult in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use\nof unobservable inputs. Performance fees are recorded as a component of other income (expense), net.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that\nis determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. Assets and\n54"

Where applicable,\nthese models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based\nobservable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities.\nThe fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of\nunobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The determination of fair value involves the use of appropriate\nvaluation methods and relevant inputs into valuation models.\nOur financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents,\nmarketable securities, derivative financial instruments, and certain non-marketable debt securities. Our financial assets\nmeasured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include non-marketable equity securities. Other financial assets and\nliabilities are carried at cost with fair value disclosed, if required.\nWe measure certain other instruments, including stock-based compensation awards settled in the stock of certain\nOther Bets, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, also at fair value on a nonrecurring\nbasis.\nFinancial Instruments\nOur financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents, marketable and non-marketable securities, derivative\nfinancial instruments and accounts receivable.\nCredit Risks\nWe are subject to credit risk from cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivative financial instruments,\nincluding foreign exchange contracts, and accounts receivable. We manage our credit risk exposure through timely\nassessment of our counterparty creditworthiness, credit limits and use of collateral management. Foreign exchange\ncontracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing. Accounts receivable are typically\nunsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the world. We manage our credit risk\nexposure by performing ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the amount of credit we extend.\nWe generally do not require collateral from our customers.\nCash Equivalents\nWe invest excess cash primarily in government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-\nbacked securities, time deposits, and money market funds.\nMarketable Securities\nWe classify all marketable debt securities that have effective maturities of three months or less from the date of\npurchase as cash equivalents and those with effective maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities\non our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable\ndebt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. We have\nclassified and accounted for our marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. After consideration of our risk versus\nreward objectives, as well as our liquidity requirements, we may sell these debt securities prior to their effective\nmaturities. As we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify highly liquid securities\nwith maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets. We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a\ncomponent of stockholders\u2019 equity, except for the changes in allowance for expected credit losses, which are recorded\nin other income (expense), net. For certain marketable debt securities we have elected the fair value option, for which\nchanges in fair value are recorded in other income (expense), net. We determine any realized gains or losses on the\nsale of marketable debt securities on a specific identification method, and we record such gains and losses as a\ncomponent of other income (expense), net.\nOur investments in marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with the related gains and losses,\nincluding unrealized, recognized in other income (expense), net.

For certain products or\nservices and customers, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer.\nAdditionally, accounts receivable includes amounts for services performed in advance of the right to invoice the\ncustomer.\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable, which is recorded as an offset to accounts\nreceivable, and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements\nof Income. We assess collectibility by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics\nexist and on an individual basis when we identify specific customers with known disputes or collectibility issues. In\ndetermining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we consider historical collectibility based on past due status\nand make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also consider\ncustomer-specific information, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic\nconditions.\nOther\nOur financial instruments also include debt and equity investments in companies with which we also have\ncommercial arrangements. For these transactions, judgment is required to assess the substance of the arrangements,\nwhether the arrangements and each component of the arrangements should be accounted for as separate\ntransactions under the applicable GAAP, as well as the determination of the value of the components of the\narrangements, including the fair value of the investments.\nImpairment of Investments\nWe periodically review our debt and non-marketable equity securities for impairment.\nFor debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists. The credit loss is\nestimated by considering available information relevant to the collectibility of the security and information about past\nevents, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Any credit loss is recorded as a charge to other\nincome (expense), net, not to exceed the amount of the unrealized loss. Unrealized losses other than the credit loss\nare recognized in AOCI. If we have an intent to sell, or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a debt\nsecurity in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis, we will write down the security to its\nfair value and record the corresponding charge as a component of other income (expense), net.\nFor non-marketable equity securities, including equity method investments, we consider whether impairment\nindicators exist by evaluating the companies' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among\nother indicators. If the assessment indicates that the investment is impaired, we write down the investment to its fair\nvalue by recording the corresponding charge as a component of other income (expense), net. We prepare quantitative\nmeasurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income approach.\n56"

Cost is\ncomputed using the first-in, first-out method.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in\nwhich we have other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity (VIE). We consolidate VIEs when we are\nthe primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have the power to direct activities that most\nsignificantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses\nor benefits. If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a\nVIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.\nPeriodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination\nof whether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment includes the following categories: land and buildings, information technology assets,\nconstruction in progress, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures. Land and buildings include land, offices,\ndata centers, and related building improvements. Information technology assets include servers and network\nequipment. Construction in progress is the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet\nbeen placed in service.\nWe account for property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation. We compute depreciation using\nthe straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which we regularly evaluate. Land is not\ndepreciated. We depreciate buildings over periods of seven to 25 years. We depreciate information technology assets\ngenerally over periods of four to five years (generally, four years for servers and five years for network equipment). We\ndepreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the\nassets. Depreciation for buildings, information technology assets, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures\ncommences once they are ready for our intended use.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-\nlease components. Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed. Non-lease components primarily\ninclude payments for maintenance and utilities. We combine fixed payments for non-lease components with lease\npayments and account for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets\nand liabilities.\nCertain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the\nlease assets and liabilities. These amounts include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index, payments\ncontingent on wind or solar production for power purchase arrangements, and payments for maintenance and utilities.\nLease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease\ncommencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our\nincremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable. Our incremental\nborrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments,\nand in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Our lease terms include periods under options to\nextend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally use the\nbase, non-cancelable, lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. Lease assets also include any\nprepaid lease payments and lease incentives.\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The current portion of our\noperating lease liabilities is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and the long-term portion is\nincluded in operating lease liabilities. Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment, net. Finance lease\nliabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or long-term debt.\nOperating lease expense (excluding variable lease costs) is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease\nterm.\nLong-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets\nWe review property and equipment and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment when events or\nchanges in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the\nlowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. We measure recoverability of these assets by\n57"

Impairments were not material for the\nperiods presented.\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. We\nevaluate our reporting units periodically, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in\nreporting units, we reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. We test our goodwill for\nimpairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be\nimpaired. Goodwill impairments were not material for the periods presented.\nIntangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis\ngenerally over periods ranging from one to twelve years, and are subsequently removed from the presentation of gross\nintangible assets and accumulated amortization once they are fully amortized.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which we recognize the amount of taxes\npayable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of\nevents that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We measure current and deferred tax\nassets and liabilities based on provisions of enacted tax law. We evaluate the realization of our deferred tax assets\nbased on all available evidence and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more\nlikely than not that they will not be realized. We have elected to account for the tax effects of the global intangible low\ntax Income provision as a current period expense.\nWe recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that, based on\ntechnical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The tax benefits of the position recognized in the\nfinancial statements are then measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be\nrealized upon settlement with a taxing authority. In addition, we recognize interest and penalties related to\nunrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the acquisition date. We allocate the\npurchase price of the acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values,\nexcept for revenue contracts acquired, which are recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The\nexcess of the purchase price over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\nForeign Currency\nWe translate the financial statements of our international subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange\nrates for assets and liabilities, and average rates for the annual period derived from month-end exchange rates for\nrevenues, costs, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in AOCI as a component of stockholders\u2019\nequity. We reflect net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction\ncurrency to functional currency as a component of foreign currency exchange gain (loss) in other income (expense),\nnet.\nPrior Period Reclassifications\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.\n58"

We exclude forward points and\ntime value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life of the\nhedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the\namount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect\nwas $171 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.\nFair Value Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our\nmarketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in the\nassessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net, along with the offsetting gains and\nlosses of the related hedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and\nrecognize changes in the excluded component in other income (expense), net.\nNet Investment Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks\nrelated to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude forward\npoints from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in other income\n(expense), net.\nOther Derivatives\nWe enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to\nhedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the\nfunctional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting\nhedges are primarily recorded in other income (expense), net along with the foreign currency gains and losses on\nmonetary assets and liabilities.\nWe also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates,\ncommodity prices, credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns. From time to time, we enter into derivatives to\nhedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains and losses arising from other\nderivatives are primarily reflected within the \u201cother\u201d component of other income (expense), net. See Note 7 for further\ndetails.\n64"

These VIEs include private companies\nthat are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve power\ngeneration using renewable sources.\nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that\nwould significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results of\noperations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We account\nfor these investments as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments.\nThe maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the\ninvestments and any future funding commitments.

We have agreed\nto hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of\nintellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the\ntime within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into\nindemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations\nto our agents.\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification\nagreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the\npayments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations,\ncash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future\npayments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows\nin a particular period.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably\npossible.\nLegal Matters\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be\nreasonably estimated.

We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect\nthe amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses\ndisclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.\nCertain outstanding matters include speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts. Significant\njudgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related\nto such matters, and we may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of\noutstanding legal matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either\nindividually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect.\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\nAntitrust Investigations\nOn November 30, 2010, the EC's Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various\nantitrust-related complaints against us.\nOn June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display and\nranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a \u20ac2.4\nbillion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision to the General\nCourt, and on September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into compliance with the\nEC's decision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2017. On November 10,\n2021, the General Court rejected our appeal, and we subsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice\non January 20, 2022.\nOn July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google\u2019s Android-related distribution\nagreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a \u20ac4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30,\n2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision, and\non October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution practices. On September 14,\n2022, the General Court reduced the fine from \u20ac4.3 billion to \u20ac4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal with the\nEuropean Court of Justice. In 2018, we recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by\n$217 million in 2022.\nOn March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that Google\nhad with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a fine of \u20ac1.5\nbillion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners' agreements,\nwhich we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed the EC decision, which remains pending.\nWe recognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019.\nFrom time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on various competition\nmatters by regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally.

The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit on October 20, 2020 alleging that\nGoogle violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising. Further, in June 2022, the\nAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the United Kingdom's Competition and\nMarkets Authority (CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\n\u2022 On December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state\ndeceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology. Additionally, on January 24, 2023, the DOJ, along\nwith a number of state Attorneys General, filed an antitrust complaint alleging that Google\u2019s digital advertising\ntechnology products violate U.S. antitrust laws. The EC, the CMA, and the ACCC each opened a formal\ninvestigation into Google's advertising technology business practices on June 22, 2021, May 25, 2022, and\nJune 29, 2022, respectively.\n\u2022 On July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for\nthe Northern District of California, alleging that Google\u2019s operation of Android and Google Play violated U.S.\nantitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In May 2022, the EC and the CMA each\nopened investigations into Google Play\u2019s business practices. Korean regulators are investigating Google Play's\nbilling practices, most recently opening a formal review in May 2022 of Google's compliance with the new app\nstore billing regulations.\nWe believe these complaints are without merit and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue to cooperate\nwith federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these\nlawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders\npreventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change\nour business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for\nus and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly\nbecome an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can\nresult in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a\nprohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important\nproducts into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against\ncertain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims,\nand may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our\ncustomers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions\nor otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\nOther\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent\norders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and\nemployment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or\npublishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, we currently\nhave a number of privacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. We also periodically have data\nincidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. Such claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government\ninvestigations, other proceedings, and consent orders could result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief,\nongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models\nand operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which could harm our\nbusiness, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, civil judgments that include compounding\npenalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including\nthose of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.\n75"

The\nsubject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the\nsale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We accrue\nnon-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when\na loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of\nloss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of\nthese matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially different from our\nexpectations.\nFor information regarding income tax contingencies see Note 14.\nNote 11. Stockholders' Equity\nClass A and Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock\nOur Board of Directors has authorized three classes of stock, Class A and Class B common stock, and Class C\ncapital stock. The rights of the holders of each class of our common and capital stock are identical, except with respect\nto voting. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock\nis entitled to 10 votes per share. Class C capital stock has no voting rights, except as required by applicable law.\nShares of Class B common stock may be converted at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically\nconvert upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock.\nStock Split\nOn July 15, 2022, the company executed a 20-for-one stock split with a record date of July 1, 2022, effected in\nthe form of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the company's Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. All\nprior period references made to share or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements\nand applicable disclosures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split. See Note 1 for\nfurther details.\nShare Repurchases\nIn April 2022, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $70.0 billion of its\nClass A and Class C shares. As of December 31, 2022, $28.1 billion remains available for Class A and Class C share\nrepurchases.\nThe following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 Year Ended December 31, 2022\nShares Amount Shares Amount\nClass A share repurchases 24 $ 3,399 61 $ 6,719\nClass C share repurchases 383 46,875 469 52,577\nTotal share repurchases 407 $ 50,274 530 $ 59,296\nClass A and Class C shares are repurchased in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its\nstockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading\nprices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. Repurchases are executed from time to time, subject to\ngeneral business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or\nprivately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an\nexpiration date.\nNote 12. Net Income Per Share\nWe compute net income per share of Class A, Class B, and Class C stock using the two-class method. Basic net\nincome per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net\nincome per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutive\nsecurities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of restricted stock units and other\ncontingently issuable shares. The dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units and other contingently issuable\nshares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the\ndiluted net income per share of Class A stock assumes the conversion of Class B stock, while the diluted net income\nper share of Class B stock does not assume the conversion of those shares.\n76"

There are other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial\nstatements.\nWe regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the\nadequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax\nauthorities and the effect, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions.\nWe believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.\nHowever, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are\nresolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for\nincome taxes in the period such resolutions occur. Although the timing of resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is\nnot certain, it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits from certain U.S. federal, state, and non U.S.\ntax positions could decrease by approximately $1.8 billion in the next 12 months. Positions that may be resolved\ninclude various U.S. and non-U.S. matters.\nNote 15. Information about Segments and Geographic Areas\nWe report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:\n\u2022 Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Google Maps,\nGoogle Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales of\napps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products such as\nYouTube Premium and YouTube TV.\n\u2022 Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for\nenterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues from fees received for Google Cloud Platform\nservices, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\n\u2022 Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from\nOther Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\nRevenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering\nactivities, and hardware, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the\nintegrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are\nmanaged centrally at a consolidated level. The associated costs, including depreciation and impairment, are allocated\nto operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage or headcount.\n82"

We expect to\nincur employee severance and related charges of $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion, the majority of which will be recognized in\nthe first quarter of 2023.\nIn addition, we are taking actions to optimize our global office space. As a result we expect to incur exit costs\nrelating to office space reductions of approximately $0.5 billion in the first quarter of 2023. We may incur additional\ncharges in the future as we further evaluate our real estate needs.\n83"

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the\neffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the\nend of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBased on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of December 31,\n2022, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to\nprovide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the\nExchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules\nand forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief\nexecutive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter\nended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting.\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our management conducted an evaluation of the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control\u2014Integrated\nFramework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework).\nBased on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of\nDecember 31, 2022.

In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there\nare resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible\ncontrols and procedures relative to their costs.\nITEM 9B.

BUSINESS\nOverview\nAs our founders Larry and Sergey wrote in the original founders' letter, \"Google is not a conventional company.\nWe do not intend to become one.\" That unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history, inspiring\nus to tackle big problems and invest in moonshots. It led us to be a pioneer in the development of AI and, since 2016,\nan AI-first company. We continue this work under the leadership of Alphabet and Google CEO, Sundar Pichai.\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses \u2014 the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments,\nGoogle Services and Google Cloud, and all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Alphabet's structure is\nabout helping each of our businesses prosper through strong leaders and independence.\nAccess and Technology for Everyone\nThe Internet is one of the world\u2019s most powerful equalizers; it propels ideas, people, and businesses large and\nsmall. Our mission to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant\ntoday as it was when we were founded in 1998. Since then, we have evolved from a company that helps people find\nanswers to a company that also helps people get things done.\nWe are focused on building an even more helpful Google for everyone, and we aspire to give everyone the tools\nthey need to increase their knowledge, health, happiness, and success. Google Search helps people find information\nand make sense of the world in more natural and intuitive ways, with trillions of searches on Google every year.\nYouTube provides people with entertainment, information, and opportunities to learn something new. Google Assistant\noffers the best way to get things done seamlessly across different devices, providing intelligent help throughout a\nperson's day, no matter where they are. Google Cloud helps customers solve today\u2019s business challenges, improve\nproductivity, reduce costs, and unlock new growth engines. We are continually innovating and building new products\nand features that will help our users, partners, customers, and communities and have invested more than $150 billion\nin research and development in the last five years in support of these efforts.\nMaking AI Helpful for Everyone\nAI is a transformational technology that can bring meaningful and positive change to people and societies across\nthe world, and for our business. At Google, we have been bringing AI into our products and services for more than a\ndecade and making them available to our users. Our journey began in 2001, when machine learning was first\nincorporated into Google Search to suggest better spellings to users searching the web. Today, AI in our products is\n4."

This led to the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, or BERT, in 2019 that helped\nSearch understand the intent of user search queries better than ever before.\nGoogle was a company built in the cloud, and we continue to invest in our Google Cloud offerings, including\nGoogle Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, to help organizations stay at the forefront of AI innovation with our AI-\noptimized infrastructure, mature AI platform and world-class models, and assistive agents.\nWe believe AI can solve some of the hardest societal, scientific and engineering challenges of our time. For\nexample, in 2020, Google DeepMind\u2019s AlphaFold system solved a 50-year-old protein folding challenge. Since then,\nwe have open-sourced to the scientific community 200 million of AlphaFold\u2019s protein structures which are used to work\non everything from accelerating new malaria vaccines to advancing cancer drug discovery and developing plastic-\neating enzymes. As another example, AI can also have a transformative effect on climate progress by providing helpful\ninformation, predicting climate-related events, and optimizing climate action. Using advanced AI and geospatial\nanalysis, Google Research has developed flood forecasting models that can provide early warning and real-time\nflooding information to communities and individuals.\nAs AI continues to improve rapidly, we are focused on giving helpful features to our users and customers as we\ndeliver on our mission to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful. With a bold\nand responsible approach, we continue to take the next steps to make this technology even more helpful for everyone.\nDeliver the Most Advanced, Safe, and Responsible AI\nWe aim to build the most advanced, safe, and responsible AI with models that are developed, trained, and\nrigorously tested at scale powered by our continued investment in AI technical infrastructure. In December 2023, we\nlaunched Gemini, our most capable and general model. It was built from the ground up to be multimodal, which means\nit can generalize and seamlessly understand, operate across, and combine different types of information, including\ntext, code, audio, images, and video. Our teams across Alphabet will leverage Gemini, as well as other AI models we\nhave previously developed and announced, across our business to deliver the best product and service experiences\nfor our users, advertisers, partners, customers, and developers.\nWe believe our approach to AI must be both bold and responsible. That means developing AI in a way that\nmaximizes the positive benefits to society while addressing the challenges, guided by our AI Principles. We published\nthese in 2018, as one of the first companies to articulate principles that put beneficial use, users, safety, and avoidance\nof harms above business considerations. While there is natural tension between being bold and being responsible, we\nbelieve it is possible \u2014 and in fact critical \u2014 to embrace that tension productively.\nEnable Organizations and Developers to Innovate on Google Cloud\nAI is not only a powerful enabler, it is also a major platform shift. Globally, businesses from startups to large\nenterprises, and the public sector are thinking about how to drive transformation. That is why we are focused on\nmaking it easy and scalable for others to innovate, and grow, with AI. That means providing the most advanced\ncomputing infrastructure and expanding access to Google\u2019s latest AI models that have been rigorously tested in our\nown products. Our Vertex AI platform gives developers the ability to train, tune, augment, and deploy applications using\ngenerative AI models and services such as Enterprise Search and Conversations. Duet AI for Google Cloud provides\npre-packaged AI agents that assist developers to write, test, document, and operate software.\nImprove Knowledge, Learning, Creativity, and Productivity\nThings that we now consider routine \u2013 like spell check, mobile check deposit, or Google Search, Google\nTranslate, and Google Maps \u2013 all use AI. As AI continues to improve rapidly, we are focused on giving helpful features\nto our users as we continue to deliver on our mission to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally\naccessible and useful.\nWhile we have been integrating AI into our products for years, we are now embedding the power of generative AI\nto continue helping our users express themselves and get things done. For example, Duet AI in Google Workspace\nhelps users write, organize, visualize, accelerate workflows, and have richer meetings. Bard allows users to\ncollaborate with experimental AI with new features that include image capabilities, coding support, and app integration.\nDream Screen, a new experimental feature in YouTube, allows for the creation of AI-generated video or image\nbackgrounds to Shorts by typing an idea into a prompt.\n5."

With Performance Max, advertisers simply tell us their campaign\ngoals and share their creative assets, and AI will automatically produce and run a highly effective ad campaign across\nall of Google\u2019s properties, to meet their budget. Product Studio brings the benefits of AI to businesses of all sizes,\nhelping them easily create uniquely-tailored imagery featuring their products \u2014 for free. Additionally, we are\nexperimenting with Search and Shopping ads that are directly integrated into the AI-powered snapshot and\nconversational mode in Search Generative Experience.\nBuild the Most Helpful Personal Computing Platforms and Devices\nOver the years, our Pixel phones have incorporated AI compute directly into the device and built experiences on\ntop of it. Our latest Pixel devices were built around AI, bringing the best AI-assistive experiences to our users, such as\nBest Take, Magic Editor, and Audio Magic Eraser. As we look ahead, we are designing our Android and Chrome\noperating systems with new AI-forward user experiences.\nMoonshots\nMany companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This\nincrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not\nevolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android and when we launched Chrome,\nbut those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer, popular browser.\nOur early investments in AI started out as moonshots but are now incorporated into our core products and central to\nfuture developments. We continue to look toward the future and to invest for the long term, most notably for the\napplication of AI to our products and services, as well as other frontier technologies such as quantum computing. As\nwe said in the original founders' letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in, as\nthey are the key to our long-term success.\nPrivacy and Security\nWe make it a priority to protect the privacy and security of our products, users, and customers, even if there are\nnear-term financial consequences. We do this by continuously investing in building products that are secure by default;\nstrictly upholding responsible data practices that emphasize privacy by design; and building easy-to-use settings that\nput people in control. We are continually enhancing these efforts over time, whether by enabling users to auto-delete\ntheir data, giving them tools, such as My Ad Center, to control their ad experience, or advancing anti-malware, anti-\nphishing, and password security features.\nGoogle\nFor reporting purposes Google comprises two segments: Google Services and Google Cloud.\nGoogle Services\nServing Our Users\nWe have always been committed to building helpful products that can improve the lives of millions of people\nworldwide. Our product innovations are what make our services widely used, and our brand one of the most\nrecognized in the world. Google Services' core products and platforms include ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Gmail,\nGoogle Drive, Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Play, Search, and YouTube, with broad and growing adoption by\nusers around the world.\nOur products and services have come a long way since the company was founded more than 25 years ago.\nWhile Google Search started as a way to find web pages, organized into ten blue links, we have driven technical\nadvancements and product innovations that have transformed Google Search into a dynamic, multimodal experience.\nWe first expanded from traditional desktop browsers into mobile web search, making it easier to navigate on smaller\nscreens. As new types of content surfaced on the internet, Universal Search made it possible to search multiple\ncontent types, like news, images, videos, and more, to deliver rich, relevant results. The introduction of new search\nmodalities, like voice and visual search, made it easier for people to express their curiosity in natural and intuitive\nways. We took that a step further with multisearch, which lets people search with text and images at the same time.\nLarge language models like BERT and Multitask Unified Models, or MUMs, have made it possible to express more\nnatural language queries, vastly improving the quality of results. Each advancement has made it easier and more\nnatural for people to find what they are looking for.\nThis drive to make information more accessible and helpful has led us over the years to improve the discovery\nand creation of digital content both on the web and through platforms like Google Play and YouTube. People are\nconsuming many forms of digital content, including watching videos, streaming TV, playing games, listening to music,\n6."

For example, for advertising, competing successfully depends\non attracting and retaining:\n\u2022 users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance\nof our advertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and availability of our products and services;\n\u2022 advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver\ntheir advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels; and\n\u2022 content providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners\ngenerate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\n8."

Sustainability is one of\nour core values at Google, and we strive to build sustainability into everything we do. We have been a leader on\nsustainability and climate change since Google\u2019s founding more than 25 years ago.\nOur sustainability work is focused on empowering individuals to take action, working together with our partners\nand customers, and working to reduce our carbon footprint across our operations and supply chain.\nIn 2020, we shared our aspiration to help individuals, cities, and other partners collectively reduce one gigaton of\ntheir carbon equivalent emissions annually by 2030. This is an ambitious vision that we have set to push us to\ncontribute meaningfully to helping with climate solutions beyond our own operations and value chain.\nIn 2021, we set an ambitious goal to achieve net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain, by\n2030. To accomplish this, we aim to reduce 50% of our combined Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), and Scope 3\nabsolute emissions (versus our 2019 baseline) before 2030, and plan to invest in nature-based and technology-based\ncarbon removal solutions to neutralize our remaining emissions. We have formally committed to the Science Based\nTargets initiative to seek their validation of our absolute emissions reduction target.\nOne of the key levers for reducing emissions from our operations is transitioning to clean energy. Since 2017, we\nhave matched 100% of the electricity consumption of our global operations with purchases of renewable energy on an\nannual basis. However, because of differences in the availability of renewable energy sources like solar and wind\nacross the regions where we operate\u2014and because of the variable supply of these resources\u2014we still need to rely on\ncarbon-emitting energy sources that power local grids. That is why we set a goal to run on 24/7 carbon-free energy\n(CFE) on every grid where we operate by 2030.\nAchieving net-zero emissions and 24/7 CFE by 2030 are extremely ambitious goals. We also know that our path\nto net-zero emissions will not be easy or linear. Some of our plans may take years to deliver results, particularly where\nthey involve building new large-scale infrastructure with long lead times. So as our business continues to evolve, we\nexpect our emissions to rise before dropping towards our absolute emissions reduction target.\nTo benefit the people and places where we operate, we have set goals to replenish 120% of the freshwater\nvolume we consume, on average, across our offices and data centers by 2030 and to help restore and improve the\nquality of water and health of ecosystems in the communities where we operate.\nWe also aim to maximize the reuse of finite resources across our operations, products, and supply chains. Our\ncircularity principles focus on designing out waste from the start, keeping materials in use for as long as possible, and\npromoting healthy materials\u2014for our data centers, workplaces, and products.\nMore information on our approach to sustainability can be found in our annual sustainability reports, including\nGoogle\u2019s Environmental Report. The contents of our sustainability reports are not incorporated by reference into this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC. For additional information about\nrisks and uncertainties applicable to our commitments to attain certain sustainability goals, see Item 1A Risk Factors of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCulture and Workforce\nWe are a company of curious, talented, and passionate people. We embrace collaboration and creativity, and\nencourage the iteration of ideas to address complex challenges in technology and society.\nOur people are critical for our continued success, so we work hard to create an environment where employees\ncan have fulfilling careers, and be happy, healthy, and productive. We offer industry-leading benefits and programs to\ntake care of the diverse needs of our employees and their families, including opportunities for career growth and\ndevelopment, resources to support their financial health, and access to excellent healthcare choices. Our competitive\ncompensation programs help us to attract and retain top candidates, and we will continue to invest in recruiting\ntalented people to technical and non-technical roles, and rewarding them well. We provide a variety of high quality\ntraining and support to managers to build and strengthen their capabilities-\u2013ranging from courses for new managers, to\nlearning resources that help them provide feedback and manage performance, to coaching and individual support.\nAt Alphabet, we are committed to making diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do and to growing a\nworkforce that is representative of the users we serve.

            "text": "Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to\nthose described below, which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results, and affect\nthe trading price of our Class A and Class C stock.\nRisks Specific to our Company\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising. Reduced spending by advertisers, a\nloss of partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to customize\nads could harm our business.\nWe generated more than 75% of total revenues from online advertising in 2023. Many of our advertisers,\ncompanies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their\ncontracts with us at any time. These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value\n(such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more effective\nmonetization) than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practices, such as\nour initiatives to phase out third-party cookies, as well as changes to other companies\u2019 advertising and/or data privacy\npractices have in the past, and may in the future, affect the advertising that we are able to provide. In addition,\ntechnologies have been developed that make customized ads more difficult, or that block the display of ads altogether,\nand some providers of online services have integrated these technologies that could potentially impair the availability\nand functionality of third-party digital advertising. Failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively\nand competitively could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions. Adverse\nmacroeconomic conditions have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in\nfluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and\noperating results.\nWe face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that\nare useful to users, customers, and other partners, we may not remain competitive, which could harm our\nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. Our businesses face changing\ntechnologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete successfully,\nwe must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful products, services,\nand technologies in a timely manner. As our businesses evolve, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a\nwider range of products and services. We must continue to invest significant resources in technical infrastructure and\nR&D, including through acquisitions, in order to enhance our technology, products, and services.\nWe have many competitors in different industries. Our current and potential domestic and international\ncompetitors range from large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Some competitors have longer\noperating histories and well-established relationships in various sectors. They can use their experience and resources\nin ways that could affect our competitive position, including by making acquisitions and entering into other strategic\narrangements; continuing to invest heavily in technical infrastructure, R&D, and in talent; initiating intellectual property\nand competition claims (whether or not meritorious); and continuing to compete for users, advertisers, customers, and\ncontent providers. Further, discrepancies in enforcement of existing laws may enable our lesser known competitors to\naggressively interpret those laws without commensurate scrutiny, thereby affording them competitive advantages. Our\ncompetitors may also be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can or may foresee the\nneed for products and services before we do.\nWe are expanding our investment in AI across the entire company. This includes generative AI and continuing to\nintegrate AI capabilities into our products and services. AI technology and services are highly competitive, rapidly\nevolving, and require significant investment, including development and operational costs, to meet the changing needs\nand expectations of our existing users and attract new users. Our ability to deploy certain AI technologies critical for\nour products and services and for our business strategy may depend on the availability and pricing of third-party\nequipment and technical infrastructure. Additionally, other companies may develop AI products and technologies that\nare similar or superior to our technologies or more cost-effective to deploy. Other companies may also have (or in the\nfuture may obtain) patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit, or interfere with our ability to make, use,\nor sell our own AI products and services.\nOur financial condition and operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive to the\nevolving needs and desires of our users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. As new and\nexisting technologies continue to develop, competitors and new entrants may be able to offer experiences that are, or\n11."

Competitors\u2019 success in providing compelling products and services or in attracting\nand retaining users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers could harm our financial condition and\noperating results.\nOur ongoing investment in new businesses, products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and\ncould divert management attention and harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services, and technologies in a\nwide range of industries beyond online advertising. The investments that we are making across our businesses, such\nas building AI capabilities into new and existing products and services, reflect our ongoing efforts to innovate and\nprovide products and services that are helpful to users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. Our\ninvestments ultimately may not be commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital and, in\npursuing new strategies, we may incur unanticipated liabilities. Innovations in our products and services could also\nresult in changes to user behavior and affect our revenue trends. These endeavors involve significant risks and\nuncertainties, including diversion of resources and management attention from current operations, different\nmonetization models, and the use of alternative investment, governance, or compensation structures that may fail to\nadequately align incentives across the company or otherwise accomplish their objectives.\nWithin Google Services, we continue to invest heavily in devices, including our smartphones, home devices, and\nwearables, which is a highly competitive market with frequent introduction of new products and services, rapid\nadoption of technological advancements by competitors, increased market saturation in developed countries, short\nproduct life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in performance characteristics, and price and\nfeature sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. There can be no assurance we will be able to provide\ndevices that compete effectively.\nWithin Google Cloud, we devote significant resources to develop and deploy our enterprise-ready cloud services,\nincluding Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, and we are advancing our AI platforms and models to\nsupport these tools and technologies. We are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud\ncomputing services, invest in cybersecurity, and hire talent, particularly to support and scale our sales force. At the\nsame time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services. Pricing and delivery models\nare competitive and constantly evolving, and we may not attain sufficient scale and profitability to achieve our business\nobjectives. Further, our business with public sector customers may present additional risks, including regulatory\ncompliance risks. For instance, we may be subject to government audits and cost reviews, and any failure to comply or\nany deficiencies found may expose us to legal, financial, and/or reputational risks. Evolving laws and regulations may\nrequire us to make new capital investments, build new products, and seek partners to deliver localized services in\nother countries, and we may not be able to meet sovereign operating requirements.\nWithin Other Bets, we are investing significantly in the areas of health, life sciences, and transportation, among\nothers. These investment areas face intense competition from large, experienced, and well-funded competitors, and\nour offerings, many of which involve the development of new and emerging technologies, may not be successful, or be\nable to compete effectively or operate at sufficient levels of profitability.\nIn addition, new and evolving products and services, including those that use AI, raise ethical, technological,\nlegal, regulatory, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and\nservices. Because all of these investment areas are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies\nand offerings will be successful or will not harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time, and we may experience downward pressure on our\noperating margin in the future.\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including changes in the\ndevices and modalities used to access our products and services; changes in geographic mix; deceleration or declines\nin advertiser spending; competition; customer usage and demand for our products; decreases in our pricing of our\nproducts and services; ongoing product and policy changes; and shifts to lower priced products and services.\nIn addition, we may experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from a variety of factors,\nsuch as an increase in the mix of lower-margin products and services, in particular from the continued expansion of our\nbusiness into new fields, including products and services such as our devices, Google Cloud, and consumer\nsubscription products, as well as significant investments in Other Bets, all of which may have margins lower than those\nwe generate from advertising. In particular, margins on our devices have had, and may continue to have, an adverse\neffect on our consolidated margins due to pressures on pricing and higher cost of sales. We may also experience\n12."

Further, certain of our costs and expenses are generally less variable in nature and\nmay not correlate to changes in revenue. We may also not be able to execute our efforts to re-engineer our cost base\nsuccessfully or in a timely manner. Due to these factors and the evolving nature of our business, our historical revenue\ngrowth rate and historical operating margin may not be indicative of our future performance. For additional information,\nsee Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect and Revenues and Monetization Metrics in Part II, Item 7 of this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of\nour products, services, and brands as well as affect our ability to compete.\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for\nus. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products,\nservices, and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country\nin which our products and services are distributed or made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have\ntaken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Although we seek to obtain patent protection\nfor our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Moreover, we may not have\nadequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. There is always the\npossibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or\nunenforceable.\nWe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy of such trade secrets and\nother sensitive information could be compromised, which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting\nfrom these trade secrets. We also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word\n\u201cGoogle\u201d could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word \u201csearch.\u201d Some courts have\nruled that \"Google\" is a protectable trademark, but it is possible that other courts, particularly those outside of the U.S.,\nmay reach a different determination. If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in\nother people using the word \u201cGoogle\u201d to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand.\nAny significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete.\nAlso, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of\nour intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our financial condition and operating\nresults.\nOur business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our\nability to expand our base of users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners.\nOur strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the\nbrands within Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch\nnew and innovative products and services that better serve the needs of our users, advertisers, customers, content\nproviders, and other partners. Our brands have been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by a number of\nfactors, including, among others, reputational issues, third-party content shared on our platforms, data privacy and\nsecurity issues and developments, and product or technical performance failures. For example, if we fail to respond\nappropriately to the sharing of misinformation or objectionable content on our services and/or products or objectionable\npractices by advertisers, or otherwise to adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence in our\nbrands.\nFurthermore, failure to maintain and enhance our brands could harm our business, reputation, financial condition,\nand operating results. Our success will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to\nprovide high-quality, trustworthy, innovative products and services that are truly useful and play a valuable role in a\nrange of settings.\nWe face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that could harm our business, financial\ncondition, and operating results.\nWe face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management, which could affect our ability\nto supply both our products and our services.\nWe rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture or assemble our devices and servers and networking\nequipment used in our technical infrastructure, and we may supply the contract manufacturers with components to\nassemble the devices and equipment. We also rely on other companies to participate in the supply of components and\ndistribution of our products and services.

In\naddition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international operations expose us to other risks, including the\nfollowing:\n\u2022 restrictions on foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent\nus from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.;\n\u2022 sanctions, import and export controls, other market access barriers, political unrest, geopolitical tensions,\nchanges in regimes, or armed conflict (such as ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine), any of which\nmay affect our business continuity, increase our operating costs, limit demand for our products and services,\nlimit our ability to source components or final products, or prevent or impede us from operating in certain\njurisdictions, complying with local laws, or offering products or services;\n\u2022 longer payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud;\n\u2022 an evolving foreign policy landscape that may adversely affect our revenues and could subject us to litigation,\nnew regulatory costs and challenges (including new customer requirements), uncertainty regarding regulatory\noutcomes, and other liabilities under local laws that may not offer due process or clear legal precedent;\n\u2022 anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting certain\npayments to government officials, violations of which could result in civil and criminal penalties; and\n\u2022 different employee/employer relationships, existence of works councils and differing labor practices, and other\nchallenges caused by distance, language, local expertise, and cultural differences, increasing the complexity\nof doing business in multiple jurisdictions.\nBecause we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results in U.S. dollars,\nwe have faced, and will continue to face, exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Although we\nhedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S.\ndollar and foreign currencies have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our revenues and earnings.\nHedging programs are also inherently risky and could expose us to additional risks that could harm our financial\ncondition and operating results.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in the fair values of our investments and, in some instances, our financial\nstatements incorporate inherently subjective valuation methodologies.\nThe fair value of our debt and equity investments may in the future be, and certain investments have been in the\npast, negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, performance and financial results of the underlying\nentities, foreign exchange rates, changes in interest rates, including changes that may result from the implementation\nof new benchmark rates, the effect of new or changing regulations, the stock market in general, or other factors.\nWe measure certain of our non-marketable equity and debt securities, certain other instruments including stock-\nbased compensation awards settled in the stock of Other Bet companies, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in\na business combination, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, which is inherently subjective and requires management\njudgment and estimation. All gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities are recognized in OI&E, which\nincreases the volatility of our OI&E. The unrealized gains and losses or impairments we record from fair value\nremeasurements in any particular period may differ significantly from the gains or losses we ultimately realize on such\ninvestments.\nAs a result of these factors, the value of our investments could decline, which could harm our financial condition\nand operating results.\nRisks Related to our Industry\nPeople access our products and services through a variety of platforms and devices that continue to\nevolve with the advancement of technology and user preferences. If manufacturers and users do not widely\nadopt versions of our products and services developed for these interfaces, our business could be harmed.\nPeople access our products and services through a growing variety of devices such as desktop computers,\nmobile phones, smartphones, laptops and tablets, video game consoles, voice-activated speakers, wearables\n(including virtual reality and augmented reality devices), automobiles, and television-streaming devices. Our products\nand services may be less popular on some interfaces. Each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical\nstandards for its devices, and our products and services may not be available or may only be available with limited\nfunctionality for our users or our advertisers on these devices as a result. Some manufacturers may also elect not to\ninclude our products on their devices. In addition, search queries may be undertaken via voice-activated search, apps,\n15."

It is hard to predict the challenges we may encounter\nin adapting our products and services and developing competitive new products and services. We expect to continue\nto devote significant resources to creating and supporting products and services across multiple platforms and devices.\nFailing to attract and retain a substantial number of new device manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, developers, and\nusers, or failing to develop products and technologies that work well on new devices and platforms, could harm our\nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results and ability to capture future business opportunities.\nIssues in the development and use of AI may result in reputational harm and increased liability exposure.\nOur evolving AI-related efforts may give rise to risks related to harmful content, inaccuracies, discrimination,\nintellectual property infringement or misappropriation, defamation, data privacy, cybersecurity, and other issues. As a\nresult of these and other challenges associated with innovative technologies, our implementation of AI systems could\nsubject us to competitive harm, regulatory action, legal liability (including under new and proposed legislation and\nregulations), new applications of existing data protection, privacy, intellectual property, and other laws, and brand or\nreputational harm.\nSome uses of AI will present ethical issues and may have broad effects on society. In order to implement AI\nresponsibly and minimize unintended harmful effects, we have already devoted and will continue to invest significant\nresources to develop, test, and maintain our products and services, but we may not be able to identify or resolve all AI-\nrelated issues, deficiencies, and/or failures before they arise. Unintended consequences, uses, or customization of our\nAI tools and systems may negatively affect human rights, privacy, employment, or other social concerns, which may\nresult in claims, lawsuits, brand or reputational harm, and increased regulatory scrutiny, any of which could harm our\nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results.\nData privacy and security concerns relating to our technology and our practices could harm our\nreputation, cause us to incur significant liability, and deter current and potential users or customers from\nusing our products and services. Computer viruses, software bugs or defects, security breaches, and attacks\non our systems could result in the improper disclosure and use of user data and interference with our users\u2019\nand customers\u2019 ability to use our products and services, harming our business and reputation.\nConcerns about, including the adequacy of, our practices with regard to the collection, use, governance,\ndisclosure, or security of personal data or other data-privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could harm our\nbusiness, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Our policies and practices may change over time as\nexpectations and regulations regarding privacy and data change.\nOur products and services involve the storage, handling, and transmission of proprietary and other sensitive\ninformation. Software bugs, theft, misuse, defects, vulnerabilities in our products and services, and security breaches\nexpose us to a risk of loss or improper use and disclosure of such information, which could result in litigation and other\npotential liabilities, including regulatory fines and penalties, as well as reputational harm. Additionally, our products\nincorporate highly technical and complex technologies, and thus our technologies and software have contained, and\nare likely in the future to contain, undetected errors, bugs, and/or vulnerabilities. We continue to add new features\ninvolving AI to our offerings and internal systems, and features that rely on AI may be susceptible to unanticipated\nsecurity threats as our and the market\u2019s understanding of AI-centric security risks and protection methods continue to\ndevelop. We have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, some errors in our software code only after\nwe have released the code. Systems and control failures, security breaches, failure to comply with our privacy policies,\nand/or inadvertent disclosure of user data could result in government and legal exposure, seriously harm our\nreputation, brand, and business, and impair our ability to attract and retain users or customers. Such incidents have\noccurred in the past and may continue to occur due to the scale and nature of our products and services. While there\nis no guarantee that such incidents will not cause significant damage, we expect to continue to expend significant\nresources to maintain security protections that limit the effect of bugs, theft, misuse, and security vulnerabilities or\nbreaches.\nWe experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis.\nCyber attacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods\nof time. We have seen, and will continue to see, industry-wide software supply chain vulnerabilities, which could affect\nour or other parties\u2019 systems. We expect to continue to experience such incidents or vulnerabilities in the future. Our\nefforts to address undesirable activity on our platform may also increase the risk of retaliatory attack. In addition, we\nface the risk of cyber attacks by nation-states and state-sponsored actors. These attacks may target us or our\ncustomers, particularly our public sector customers (including federal, state, and local governments). Geopolitical\ntensions or armed conflicts, such as the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and Ukraine, may increase these risks.\nWe may experience security issues, whether due to employee or insider error or malfeasance, system errors, or\nvulnerabilities in our or other parties\u2019 systems.

Because the\ntechniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, disable or degrade service provided by or otherwise sabotage\nsystems change frequently and often are recognized only after being launched against a target, even taking all\nreasonable precautions, including those required by law, we have been unable in the past and may continue to be\nunable to anticipate or detect attacks or vulnerabilities or implement adequate preventative measures.\nFurther, if any partners with whom we share user or other customer information fail to implement adequate data-\nsecurity practices, fail to comply with our terms and policies, or otherwise suffer a network or other security breach, our\nusers\u2019 data may be improperly accessed, used, or disclosed. If an actual or perceived breach of our or our business\npartners\u2019 or service providers\u2019 security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures\nwould be harmed, we could lose users and customers, our trade secrets or those of our business partners may be\ncompromised, and we may be exposed to significant legal and financial risks, including legal claims (which may\ninclude class-action litigation) and regulatory actions, fines, and penalties. Any of the foregoing consequences could\nharm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWhile we have dedicated significant resources to privacy and security incident response capabilities, including\ndedicated worldwide incident response teams, our response process, particularly during times of a natural disaster or\npandemic, may not be adequate, may fail to accurately assess the severity of an incident, may not be fast enough to\nprevent or limit harm, or may fail to sufficiently remediate an incident. As a result, we may suffer significant legal,\nreputational, or financial exposure, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nFor additional information, see also our risk factor on privacy and data protection regulations under \u2018Risks Related\nto Laws, Regulations, and Policies\u2019 below.\nOur ongoing investments in safety, security, and content review will likely continue to identify abuse of\nour platforms and misuse of user data.\nIn addition to our efforts to prevent and mitigate cyber attacks, we are making significant investments in safety,\nsecurity, and review efforts to combat misuse of our services and unauthorized access to user data by third parties,\nincluding investigation and review of platform applications that could access the information of users of our services.\nAs a result of these efforts, we have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, incidents of unnecessary\naccess to or misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties. However, we may not have discovered,\nand may in the future not discover, all such incidents or activity, whether as a result of our data limitations, including\nour lack of visibility over our encrypted services, the scale of activity on our platform, or other factors, including factors\noutside of our control such as a natural disaster or pandemic, and we may learn of such incidents or activity via third\nparties. Such incidents and activities may include the use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our\nterms, contracts or policies, the existence of false or undesirable user accounts, election interference, improper ad\npurchases, activities that threaten people\u2019s safety on- or off-line, or instances of spamming, scraping, or spreading\ndisinformation. While we may not determine some of these incidents to be material at the time they occurred and we\nmay remedy them quickly, there is no guarantee that these issues will not ultimately result in significant legal, financial,\nand reputational harm, including government inquiries and enforcement actions, litigation, and negative publicity. There\nis also no guarantee that a series of related issues may not be determined to be material at a later date in the\naggregate, even if they may not be material individually at the time of their occurrence.\nWe may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise prevent or remediate any such\nincidents. Any of the foregoing developments may negatively affect user trust and engagement, harm our reputation\nand brands, require us to change our business practices in ways that harm our business operations, and adversely\naffect our business and financial results. Any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and\nregulatory inquiries, which could result in monetary penalties and damages, divert management\u2019s time and attention,\nand lead to enhanced regulatory oversight.\nProblematic content on our platforms, including low-quality user-generated content, web spam, content\nfarms, and other violations of our guidelines could affect the quality of our services, which could harm our\nreputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services.\nWe, like others in the industry, face violations of our content guidelines across our platforms, including\nsophisticated attempts by bad actors to manipulate our hosting and advertising systems to fraudulently generate\nrevenues, or to otherwise generate traffic that does not represent genuine user interest or intent.

Increased use of AI in our offerings and internal systems may create new avenues of\nabuse for bad actors.\nMany websites violate or attempt to violate our guidelines, including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in\nsearch results than our search engine's assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them. Such efforts have\naffected, and may continue to affect, the quality of content on our platforms and lead them to display false, misleading,\nor undesirable content. Although English-language web spam in our search results has been reduced, and web spam\nin most other languages is limited, we expect web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improve their\nrankings. Although we continue to invest in and deploy proprietary technology to detect and prevent web spam on our\nplatforms, there is no guarantee that our technology will always be successful, and our users may have negative\nexperiences on our platforms if our technology fails to work as intended, which may affect our users' decisions in\ncontinuing to use our platforms. We also face other challenges from low-quality and irrelevant content websites,\nincluding content farms, which are websites that generate large quantities of low-quality content to help them improve\ntheir search rankings. We are continually launching algorithmic changes designed to detect and prevent abuse from\nlow-quality websites, but we may not always be successful. We also face other challenges on our platforms, including\nviolations of our content guidelines involving incidents such as attempted election interference, activities that threaten\nthe safety and/or well-being of our users on- or off-line, and the spreading of misinformation or disinformation.\nIf we fail to either detect and prevent an increase in problematic content or effectively promote high-quality\ncontent, it could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information or reduce use of our platforms, harming our\nfinancial condition and operating results. It may also subject us to litigation and regulatory actions, which could result in\nmonetary penalties and damages and divert management\u2019s time and attention.\nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users. Internet\naccess providers may be able to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and\nservices, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers.\nOur products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet, and certain of our products\nrequire significant bandwidth to work effectively. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant\nmarket power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable\ncompanies, mobile communications companies, and government-owned service providers. Some of these providers\nhave taken, or have stated that they may take, measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user\naccess to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our\nofferings, by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings, or by providing our competitors\npreferential access. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by internet\naccess providers; however, substantial uncertainty exists in the U.S. and elsewhere regarding such protections. For\nexample, in 2018 the U.S. Federal Communications Commission repealed net neutrality rules, which could permit\ninternet access providers to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services. In\naddition, in some jurisdictions, our products and services have been subject to government-initiated restrictions or\nblockages. These could harm existing key relationships, including with our users, customers, advertisers, and/or\ncontent providers, and impair our ability to attract new ones; harm our reputation; and increase costs, thereby\nnegatively affecting our business.\nRisks Related to Laws, Regulations, and Policies\nWe are subject to a variety of new, existing, and changing laws and regulations worldwide that could\nharm our business, and will likely be subject to an even broader scope of laws and regulations as we continue\nto expand our business.\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subjects, and our\nintroduction of new businesses, products, services, and technologies will likely continue to subject us to additional laws\nand regulations. In recent years, governments around the world have proposed and adopted a large number of new\nlaws and regulations relevant to the digital economy, particularly in the areas of data privacy and security, competition,\nenvironmental, social and governance (ESG) requirements, AI, and online content. The costs of compliance with these\nmeasures are high and are likely to increase in the future.\nNew or changing laws and regulations, or new interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a\nmanner inconsistent with our practices, have resulted in, and may continue to result in, less useful products and\nservices, altered business practices, limited ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products and\nservices, substantial costs, and civil or criminal liability.

For example, while\nlegislative text has yet to be finalized and formally approved, provisional political agreement on a proposed EU\nAI Act was reached between co-legislators in December 2023, including that specific transparency and other\nrequirements would be introduced for general purpose AI systems and the models on which those systems are\nbased. In addition, the White House's Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and\nUse of Artificial Intelligence devises a framework for the U.S. government, among other things, to regulate\nprivate sector use and development of certain foundation models.\n\u2022 Data privacy, collection, and processing: Laws and regulations further restricting the collection, processing,\nand/or sharing of user or advertising-related data, including privacy and data protection laws; laws affecting the\nprocessing of children's data (as discussed further below), data breach notification laws, and laws limiting data\ntransfers (including data localization laws).\n\u2022 Copyright and other intellectual property: Copyright and related laws, including the EU Directive on\nCopyright in the Digital Single Market and European Economic Area transpositions, which may introduce new\nlicensing regimes, increase liability with respect to content uploaded by users or linked to from our platforms,\nor create property rights in news publications that could require payments to news agencies and publishers,\nwhich may result in other regulatory actions.\n\u2022 Content moderation: Various laws covering content moderation and removal, and related disclosure\nobligations, such as the EU's Digital Services Act, Florida\u2019s Senate Bill 7072 and Texas\u2019 House Bill 20, and\nlaws and proposed legislation in Singapore, Australia, and the United Kingdom that impose penalties for failure\nto remove certain types of content or require disclosure of information about the operation of our services and\nalgorithms, which may make it harder for services like Google Search and YouTube to detect and deal with\nlow-quality, deceptive, or harmful content.\n\u2022 Consumer protection: Consumer protection laws, including the EU\u2019s New Deal for Consumers, which could\nresult in monetary penalties and create a range of new compliance obligations.\nIn addition, the applicability and scope of these and other laws and regulations, as interpreted by courts,\nregulators, or administrative bodies, remain uncertain and could be interpreted in ways that harm our business. For\nexample, we rely on statutory safe harbors, like those set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Section 230\nof the Communications Decency Act in the U.S. and the E-Commerce Directive in Europe, to protect against liability for\nvarious linking, caching, ranking, recommending, and hosting activities. Legislation or court rulings affecting these safe\nharbors may adversely affect us and may impose significant operational challenges. There are legislative proposals\nand pending litigation in the U.S., EU, and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for\nwebsites and online platforms. Our development, use, and commercialization of AI products and services (including\nour implementation of AI in our offerings and internal systems) could subject us to regulatory action and legal liability,\nincluding under specific legislation regulating AI, as well as new applications of existing data protection, cybersecurity,\nprivacy, intellectual property, and other laws.\nWe are and may continue to be subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations,\nenforcement actions, consent orders, and other forms of regulatory scrutiny and legal liability that could harm\nour business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and orders\ninvolving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and\nemployment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or\npublishers using our platforms, personal injury, and other matters. We are also subject to a variety of claims including\nproduct warranty, product liability, and consumer protection claims related to product defects, among other litigation,\nand we may also be subject to claims involving health and safety, hazardous materials usage, other environmental\neffects, AI training, development, and commercialization, or service disruptions or failures. Claims have been brought,\nand we expect will continue to be brought, against us for defamation, negligence, breaches of contract, copyright and\ntrademark infringement, unfair competition, unlawful activity, torts, privacy rights violations, fraud, or other legal\ntheories based on the nature and content of information available on or via our services, the design and effect of our\nproducts and services, or due to our involvement in hosting, transmitting, marketing, branding, or providing access to\ncontent created by third parties.\n19."

We plan to appeal. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice,\nvarious U.S. states, and other plaintiffs have filed several antitrust lawsuits about various aspects of our business,\nincluding our advertising technologies and practices, the operation and distribution of Google Search, and the\noperation and distribution of the Android operating system and Play Store. Other regulatory agencies in the U.S. and\naround the world, including competition enforcers, consumer protection agencies, and data protection authorities, have\nchallenged and may continue to challenge our business practices and compliance with laws and regulations. We are\ncooperating with these investigations and defending litigation or appealing decisions where appropriate.\nVarious laws, regulations, investigations, enforcement lawsuits, and regulatory actions have involved in the past,\nand may in the future result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing\nobligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models and operations, including\ndivestiture, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which could harm our business,\nreputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nAny of these legal proceedings could result in legal costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity\nand other harms to our business.

Any failure\nor alleged failure to comply with these laws could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and\noperating results.\nAuthorities around the world have adopted and are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals\nconcerning data protection, data usage, and encryption of user data. Adverse legal rulings, legislation, or regulation\nhave resulted in, and may continue to result in, fines and orders requiring that we change our practices, which have\nhad and could continue to have an adverse effect on how we provide services, harming our business, reputation,\nfinancial condition, and operating results.

These include the\nChildren\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, and the United Kingdom Age-Appropriate Design Code, all of\nwhich address the use and disclosure of the personal data of children and minors and impose obligations on\nonline services or products directed to or likely to be accessed by children.\n\u2022 The California Internet of Things Security Law, which regulates the security of data used in connection with\ninternet-connected devices.\n\u2022 The EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act, which will require in-scope companies to obtain user consent for combining data\nacross certain products and require search engines to share anonymized data with rival companies, among\nother changes.\n20."

The validity of various data transfer mechanisms we\ncurrently rely upon remains subject to legal, regulatory, and political developments in both Europe and the U.S., which\nmay require us to adapt our existing arrangements.\nWe face, and may continue to face, intellectual property and other claims that could be costly to defend,\nresult in significant damage awards or other costs (including indemnification awards), and limit our ability to\nuse certain technologies.\nWe, like other internet, technology, and media companies, are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations\nof infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights, including patent, copyright, trade secrets, and\ntrademarks. Parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in U.S. and international courts\nand the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) for exclusion and cease-and-desist orders. In addition, patent-\nholding companies may frequently seek to generate income from patents they have obtained by bringing claims\nagainst us. As we continue to expand our business, the number of intellectual property claims against us has increased\nand may continue to increase as we develop and acquire new products, services, and technologies.\nAdverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing\nagreements (if licenses are available at all), or orders limiting our ability to sell our products and services in the U.S. or\nelsewhere, including by preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services in certain\njurisdictions. They may also cause us to change our business practices in ways that could result in a loss of revenues\nfor us and otherwise harm our business.\nMany of our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require us to defend\nagainst certain intellectual property infringement claims and in some cases indemnify them for certain intellectual\nproperty infringement claims against them, which could result in increased costs for defending such claims or\nsignificant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Such customers and partners may also\ndiscontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could\nresult in loss of revenues and harm our business. Moreover, intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our\nsuppliers, when obtainable, may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers arising from\nintellectual property infringement claims. Furthermore, in connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in\nthe future agree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, including those associated with intellectual\nproperty claims. Regardless of their merits, intellectual property claims are often time consuming and expensive to\nlitigate or settle. To the extent such claims are successful, they could harm our business, including our product and\nservice offerings, financial condition, and operating results.\nExpectations relating to ESG considerations could expose us to potential liabilities, increased costs, and\nreputational harm.\nWe are subject to laws, regulations, and other measures that govern a wide range of topics, including those\nrelated to matters beyond our core products and services. For instance, new laws, regulations, policies, and\ninternational accords relating to ESG matters, including sustainability, climate change, human capital, and diversity, are\nbeing developed and formalized in Europe, the U.S., and elsewhere, which may entail specific, target-driven\nframeworks and/or disclosure requirements. We have implemented robust ESG programs, adopted reporting\nframeworks and principles, and announced a number of goals and initiatives. The implementation of these goals and\ninitiatives may require considerable investments, and our goals, with all of their contingencies, dependencies, and in\ncertain cases, reliance on third-party verification and/or performance, are complex and ambitious, and may change.\nWe cannot guarantee that our goals and initiatives will be fully realized on the timelines we expect or at all, and\nprojects that are completed as planned may not achieve the results we anticipate. Any failure, or perceived failure, by\nus to adhere to our public statements, comply fully with developing interpretations of ESG laws and regulations, or\nmeet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could harm our business, reputation, financial\ncondition, and operating results.\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or\nexposure to additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions.\nOur effective tax rates are affected by a variety of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with\ndifferent statutory tax rates, net gains and losses on hedges and related transactions under our foreign exchange risk\nmanagement program, changes in our stock price for shares issued as employee compensation, changes in the\nvaluation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, and the application of different provisions of tax laws or changes in tax\nlaws, regulations, or accounting principles (including changes in the interpretation of existing laws).

As a result, we have\nreceived, and may in the future receive, assessments in multiple jurisdictions, on various tax-related assertions, such\nas transfer-pricing adjustments or permanent-establishment claims. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit\ncould harm our financial condition and operating results, require adverse changes to our business practices, or subject\nus to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income\ntaxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and often involves uncertainty. Although we believe our\nestimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements\nand may affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nFurthermore, due to shifting economic and political conditions, tax policies, laws, or rates in various jurisdictions\nmay be subject to significant changes in ways that could harm our financial condition and operating results. For\nexample, various jurisdictions around the world have enacted or are considering revenue-based taxes such as digital\nservices taxes and other targeted taxes, which could lead to inconsistent and potentially overlapping international tax\nregimes. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is coordinating negotiations among\nmore than 140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus around substantial changes to international tax policies,\nincluding the implementation of a minimum global effective tax rate of 15%. Our effective tax rate and cash tax\npayments could increase in future years as a result of these changes.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Stock\nWe cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program will be fully consummated or will enhance long-\nterm stockholder value, and share repurchases could increase the volatility of our stock prices and could\ndiminish our cash reserves.\nWe engage in share repurchases of our Class A and Class C stock from time to time in accordance with\nauthorizations from the Board of Directors of Alphabet. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and\ndoes not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares.\nFurther, our share repurchases could affect our share trading prices, increase their volatility, reduce our cash reserves\nand may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock.\nThe concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B stock has 10 votes per share, our Class A stock has one vote per share, and our Class C stock has\nno voting rights. As of December 31, 2023, Larry Page and Sergey Brin beneficially owned approximately 86.5% of our\noutstanding Class B stock, which represented approximately 51.5% of the voting power of our outstanding common\nstock. Through their stock ownership, Larry and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring\nstockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or\nother sale of our company or our assets, for the foreseeable future. In addition, because our Class C stock carries no\nvoting rights (except as required by applicable law), the issuance of the Class C stock, including in future stock-based\nacquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs, could continue Larry and Sergey\u2019s current\nrelative voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters\nsubmitted to a vote of our stockholders. The share repurchases made pursuant to our repurchase program may also\naffect Larry and Sergey\u2019s relative voting power. This concentrated control limits or severely restricts other stockholders\u2019\nability to influence corporate matters and we may take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial,\nwhich could reduce the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C stock.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that\nstockholders may consider favorable.\nProvisions in Alphabet\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a\nchange of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022 Our Board of Directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of\nDirectors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director.\n\u2022 Our stockholders may not act by written consent, which makes it difficult to take certain actions without holding\na stockholders' meeting.\n\u2022 Our certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of\nminority stockholders to elect director candidates.\n22."

We expect\nto continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of such potential strategic arrangements,\nwhich could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Some of the areas where we face risks include:\n\u2022 diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and\nother strategic arrangements;\n\u2022 failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities, or conditions\nplaced upon approval that could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or\notherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of a transaction;\n\u2022 failure to successfully integrate the acquired operations, technologies, services, and personnel (including\ncultural integration and retention of employees) and further develop the acquired business or technology;\n\u2022 implementation of controls (or remediation of control deficiencies), procedures, and policies at the acquired\ncompany;\n\u2022 integration of the acquired company\u2019s accounting and other administrative systems, and the coordination of\nproduct, engineering, and sales and marketing functions;\n\u2022 transition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms;\n\u2022 in the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages\nand to address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific\ncountries;\n\u2022 failure to accomplish commercial, strategic or financial objectives with respect to investments, joint ventures,\nand other strategic arrangements;\n\u2022 failure to realize the value of investments and joint ventures due to a lack of liquidity;\n23."

Discussion of 2022 results\ncompared to 2021 results to the extent not included in this report can be found in Item 7 of our 2022 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K.\nUnderstanding Alphabet\u2019s Financial Results\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses \u2014 the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments,\nGoogle Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For\nadditional information on our segments, see Part I, Item 1 Business and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTrends in Our Business and Financial Effect\nThe following long-term trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate\nthat they will continue to affect our future results:\n\u2022 Users' behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves.\nThe continuing evolution of the online world has contributed to the growth of our business and our revenues since\ninception. We expect that this evolution will continue to benefit our business and our revenues, although at a slower\npace than we have experienced historically, in particular after the outsized growth in our advertising revenues during\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we face increasing competition for user engagement and advertisers, which may\naffect our revenues.\n\u2022 Users continue to access our products and services using diverse devices and modalities, which\nallows for new advertising formats that may benefit our revenues but adversely affect our margins.\nOur users are accessing our products and services via diverse devices and modalities, such as smartphones,\nwearables, connected TVs, and smart home devices, and want to be able to be connected no matter where they are or\nwhat they are doing. We are focused on expanding our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to\nmaintain and grow our business.\nWe benefit from advertising revenues generated from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising\nformats. The margins from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional\ndesktop search. Additionally, as the market for a particular device type or modality matures, our advertising revenues\nmay be affected. For example, changing dynamics within the global smartphone market, such as increased market\nsaturation in developed countries, can affect our mobile advertising revenues.\nWe expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our revenues grow\nand TAC as a percentage of our advertising revenues (\"TAC rate\") to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic\nmix; partner agreement terms; partner mix; the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points; product\nmix; the relative revenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels; and revenue share terms.\nWe expect these trends to continue to affect our revenues and put pressure on our margins.\n\u2022 As online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings, which may affect our\nmonetization.\nAs interactions between users and advertisers change, and as online user behavior evolves, we continue to\nexpand our product offerings to serve these changing needs, which may affect our monetization. For example,\nrevenues from ads on YouTube and Google Play monetize at a lower rate than our traditional search ads. We also\nexpect to continue to incorporate AI innovations into our products, such as AI in Search, that could affect our\nmonetization trends. When developing new products and services we generally focus first on user experience and then\non monetization.\n\u2022 As users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets\ncontinue to increase, and may require continued investments. In addition, movements in foreign exchange\nrates affect such revenues.\n29."

We continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our\nproducts and advertising programs relevant to our users in these markets. This has led to a trend of increased\nrevenues from emerging markets. We expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these\nmarkets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available. This trend could affect our revenues as\ndeveloping markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets.\nInternational revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a foreign exchange risk management program\ndesigned to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues\nand earnings.\n\u2022 The revenues that we derive beyond advertising are increasing and may adversely affect our margins.\nRevenues from cloud, consumer subscriptions, platforms, and devices, which may have differing characteristics\nthan our advertising revenues, have grown over time, and we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding\nour products and services. The margins on these revenues vary significantly and are generally lower than the margins\non our advertising revenues. For example, sales of our devices adversely affect our consolidated margins due to\npressures on pricing and higher cost of sales.\n\u2022 As we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and\ncapital expenditures.\nWe continue to make significant research and development investments in areas of strategic focus as we seek to\ndevelop new, innovative offerings, improve our existing offerings, and rapidly and responsibly deploy AI across our\nbusinesses. We also expect to increase, relative to 2023, our investment in our technical infrastructure, including\nservers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term initiatives, in\nparticular in support of AI products and services. In addition, acquisitions and strategic investments contribute to the\nbreadth and depth of our offerings, expand our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, and build strong\npartnerships around strategic initiatives.\n\u2022 We continue to face an evolving regulatory environment, and we are subject to claims, lawsuits,\ninvestigations, and other forms of potential legal liability, which could affect our business practices and\nfinancial results.\nChanges in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide\nrange of topics and related legal matters, including investigations, lawsuits, and regulatory actions, have resulted in\nfines and caused us to change our business practices. As these global trends continue, our cost of doing business may\nincrease, our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products or services may be limited, and we\nmay need to change our business practices to comply with evolving regulatory and legal matters. Examples include the\nantitrust complaints filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and a number of state Attorneys General; legislative\nproposals and pending litigation in the U.S., EU, and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor\nprotection for websites and online platforms; and the Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act in Europe and various\nlegislative proposals in the U.S. focused on large technology platforms.

We expect to continue\nhiring talented employees around the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs. For additional\ninformation, see Culture and Workforce in Part I, Item 1 Business of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenues and Monetization Metrics\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide\nenterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration\ntools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and devices; and fees received for\nconsumer subscription-based products.

We believe the\npresentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles\n(GAAP) results helps improve the ability to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign\ncurrency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant\nperiod over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency\nexchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level.\nWe use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year\nbasis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable\nperiod exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.\nConstant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period\nrevenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated\nusing prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods.\nThese results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with\nGAAP.

On September 14, 2022, the General\nCourt reduced the 2018 fine from \u20ac4.3 billion to \u20ac4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal to the European Court of\nJustice.\nWhile each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities\non our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines.

The amounts to be paid under these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated and\nare not readily determinable.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In doing so, we have to make\nestimates and assumptions. Our critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of\nuncertainty at the time the estimate was made, and changes in them have had or are reasonably likely to have a\nmaterial effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from\nour estimates. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable\nunder the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We have reviewed our critical\naccounting estimates with the Audit and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors.\nFor a summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements, see Note 1 of the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFair Value Measurements of Non-Marketable Equity Securities\nWe measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, consisting primarily of our non-\nmarketable equity securities.

These adjustments\nrequire quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities, which may require the use of unobservable inputs.\nAdjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date and involve the use of\nestimates using the best information available, which may include cash flow projections or other available market data.\nNon-marketable equity securities are also evaluated for impairment, based on qualitative factors including the\ncompanies' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among others. When indicators of\nimpairment exist, we prepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market\napproach or an income approach, which requires judgment and the use of unobservable inputs, including discount\nrates, investee revenues and costs, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others.\n43."

We evaluate uncertain\ntax positions periodically, considering changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial\nopinions, as well as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates,\nand equity investment risks.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. International revenues, as well as costs and expenses\ndenominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the\nU.S. dollar. As discussed below, we enter into derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency risk. Principal\ncurrencies hedged included the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro, and Japanese yen. For the\npurpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk, we considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange\nrates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% could be\nexperienced.\nWe use foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on assets and liabilities\ndenominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. These forward and option contracts\nreduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and\nliabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on these assets and liabilities are recorded in OI&E, which are offset\nby the gains and losses on the forward and option contracts.\nIf an adverse 10% foreign currency exchange rate change was applied to total monetary assets, liabilities, and\ncommitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies at the balance sheet date, it would have\nresulted in an adverse effect on income before income taxes of approximately $136 million and $503 million as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively, after consideration of the effect of foreign exchange contracts in place for\nthe years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023.\nWe use foreign currency forward and option contracts, including collars (an option strategy comprised of a\ncombination of purchased and written options) to protect forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from changes in\nforeign currency exchange rates. When the U.S. dollar strengthens, gains from foreign currency forward and option\ncontacts reduce the foreign currency losses related to our earnings. When the U.S. dollar weakens, losses from foreign\ncurrency forward and option contracts offset the foreign currency gains related to our earnings. These hedging\ncontracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We designate\nthese contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. We reflect the gains or losses of foreign currency spot\nrate changes as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and subsequently reclassify them\ninto revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur.\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10% as of December 31, 2022 and 2023, the amount recorded in AOCI related to\nour cash flow hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion lower as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively. The change in the value recorded in AOCI would be expected to offset a\ncorresponding foreign currency change in forecasted hedged revenues when recognized.\nWe use foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency\nrisks related to investment in foreign subsidiaries. These forward contracts serve to offset the foreign currency\ntranslation risk from our foreign operations.\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10%, the amount recorded in cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) within AOCI\nrelated to our net investment hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $903 million and $946 million\nlower as of December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively. The change in value recorded in CTA would be expected to\noffset a corresponding foreign currency translation gain or loss from our investment in foreign subsidiaries.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur Corporate Treasury investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and\nmaintain liquidity. We invest primarily in debt securities, including government bonds, corporate debt securities,\nmortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, money market and other funds, time deposits, and interest rate\nderivatives. By policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and\nfloating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair\nmarket value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income\nthan predicted if interest rates fall. Unrealized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to\ninterest rate fluctuations as compared to interest rates at the time of purchase. For certain fixed and variable rate debt\nsecurities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in OI&E. We measure\nsecurities for which we have not elected the fair value option at fair value with gains and losses recorded in AOCI until\nthe securities are sold, less any expected credit losses.\n45."

These investments, especially those that are in the\nearly stages, are inherently risky because the technologies or products these companies have under development are\ntypically in the early phases and may never materialize, and they may experience a decline in financial condition,\nwhich could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. Valuations of our equity\ninvestments in private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data and\nobservable transactions at lower valuations could result in significant losses. In addition, global economic conditions\ncould result in additional volatility. The success of our investment in any private company is also typically dependent on\nthe likelihood of our ability to realize appreciation in the value of investments through liquidity events such as public\nofferings, acquisitions, private sales or other market events. Changes in the valuation of non-marketable equity\nsecurities may not directly correlate with changes in valuation of marketable equity securities. As of December 31,\n2022 and 2023, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities, which were accounted for under the\nmeasurement alternative, was $28.5 billion and $28.8 billion, respectively.\nThe carrying values of our equity method investments, which totaled approximately $1.7 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2023, generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes. However, these investments\ncould be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value and is not expected to recover.\nFor additional information about our equity investments, see Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n46."

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August\n2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became\nthe successor issuer to Google.\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide\nenterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales\nof other products and services, such as fees received for consumer subscription-based products, apps and in-app\npurchases, and devices.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated\nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes.\nActual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our\nestimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; content licenses; contingent liabilities; fair values\nof financial instruments and goodwill; income taxes; inventory; and useful lives of property and equipment, among\nothers. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable,\nand the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and\nadjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain\nnetwork equipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal\nyear 2023. Based on the carrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December 31, 2022, and those\nplaced in service during the year ended December 31, 2023, the effect of this change in estimate was a reduction in\ndepreciation expense of $3.9 billion and an increase in net income of $3.0 billion, or $0.24 per basic and $0.24 per\ndiluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, and\nthe collectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or services is probable. Sales and other\nsimilar taxes are excluded from revenues.\nAdvertising Revenues\nWe generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on:\n\u2022 Google Search and other properties, including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners\nwho use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated\nproperties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n\u2022 YouTube properties; and\n\u2022 Google Network properties, including revenues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob,\nAdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\nOur customers generally purchase advertising inventory through Google Ads, Google Ad Manager, Google\nDisplay & Video 360, and Google Marketing Platform, among others.\nWe offer advertising by delivering both performance and brand advertising. We recognize revenues for\nperformance advertising when a user engages with the advertisement. For brand advertising, we recognize revenues\nwhen the ad is displayed, or a user views the ad.\nFor ads placed on Google Network properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on\na gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed\non Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues,\n56."

We report\nrevenues from Google Play app sales and in-app purchases on a net basis, because our performance obligation is to\nfacilitate a transaction between app developers and end users, for which we earn a service fee.\nGoogle Cloud Revenues\nGoogle Cloud revenues consist of revenues from:\n\u2022 Google Cloud Platform, which generates consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure,\nplatform, and other services. These services provide access to solutions such as cybersecurity, databases,\nanalytics, and AI offerings including our AI infrastructure, Vertex AI platform, and Duet AI for Google Cloud;\n\u2022 Google Workspace, which includes subscriptions for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for\nenterprises, such as Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Drive, and Meet, with integrated features like Duet AI in Google\nWorkspace; and\n\u2022 other enterprise services.\nOur cloud services are generally provided on either a consumption or subscription basis and may have contract\nterms longer than a year. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis are recognized when\nthe customer utilizes the services, based on the quantity of services consumed. Revenues related to cloud services\nprovided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer receives and\nconsumes the benefits of the cloud services.\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate\nrevenues to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine\nstandalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers.\nCustomer Incentives and Credits\nCertain customers receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration.\nWe estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues. We\nbelieve that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration.\nSales Commissions\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred when the period of the expected benefit is one year or less. We\nrecognize an asset for certain sales commissions and amortize if the expected benefit period is greater than one year.\nThese costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues consists of TAC and other costs of revenues.\n\u2022 TAC includes:\n\u25e6 amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services.\nOur distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers,\nand software developers; and\n\u25e6 amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n57."

As a result, development costs\nthat meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented.\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and\ncloud-based applications used to deliver our services. We capitalize development costs related to these software\napplications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the\nsoftware will be used to perform the function intended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications\nwere not material for the periods presented.\nStock-based Compensation\nStock-based compensation (SBC) primarily consists of Alphabet restricted stock units (RSUs). RSUs are equity\nclassified and measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. We recognize RSU expense\nusing the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur.\nFor RSUs, shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory income tax withholding to be\npaid by us on behalf of our employees. As a result, fewer shares are issued than the number of RSUs outstanding, and\nthe income tax withholding is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.\nAdditionally, SBC includes other stock-based awards, such as performance stock units (PSUs) that include\nmarket conditions and awards that may be settled in cash or the stock of certain Other Bet companies. PSUs and\ncertain awards granted by Other Bet companies are equity classified and expense is recognized over the requisite\nservice period. Certain awards granted by Other Bet companies are liability classified and remeasured at fair value\nthrough settlement. The fair value of awards granted by Other Bet companies is based on the equity valuation of the\nrespective Other Bet company.\nAdvertising and Promotional Expenses\nWe expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred. For the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $7.9 billion, $9.2\nbillion, and $8.7 billion, respectively.\nPerformance Fees\nPerformance fees refer to compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain\ninvestments. We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may\nresult in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use\nof unobservable inputs. Performance fees are recorded as a component of OI&E.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that\nis determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. Assets and\nliabilities recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with a three-tier fair value hierarchy based\non the observability of the inputs available in the market used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active\nmarkets.\n58."

Where applicable,\nthese models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based\nobservable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities.\nThe fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of\nunobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The determination of fair value involves the use of appropriate\nvaluation methods and relevant inputs into valuation models.\nOur financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents,\nmarketable securities, derivative financial instruments, and certain non-marketable debt securities. Our financial assets\nmeasured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include non-marketable equity securities. Other financial assets and\nliabilities are carried at cost with fair value disclosed, if required.\nWe measure certain other instruments, including SBC awards settled in the stock of Other Bet companies, and\ncertain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, also at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.\nFinancial Instruments\nOur financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents, marketable and non-marketable securities, derivative\nfinancial instruments and accounts receivable.\nCredit Risks\nWe are subject to credit risk primarily from cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, derivative financial\ninstruments, including foreign exchange contracts, and accounts receivable. We manage our credit risk exposure\nthrough timely assessment of our counterparty creditworthiness, credit limits and use of collateral management.\nForeign exchange contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing. Accounts\nreceivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the world.\nWe manage our credit risk exposure by performing ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the\namount of credit we extend. We generally do not require collateral from our customers.\nCash Equivalents\nWe invest excess cash primarily in government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-\nbacked securities, time deposits, and money market funds.\nMarketable Securities\nWe classify all marketable debt securities that have effective maturities of three months or less from the date of\npurchase as cash equivalents and those with effective maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities\non our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable\ndebt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. We have\nclassified and accounted for our marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. After consideration of our risk versus\nreward objectives, as well as our liquidity requirements, we may sell these debt securities prior to their effective\nmaturities. As we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify highly liquid securities\nwith maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets. We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a\ncomponent of stockholders\u2019 equity, except for the changes in allowance for expected credit losses, which are recorded\nin OI&E. For certain marketable debt securities we have elected the fair value option, for which changes in fair value\nare recorded in OI&E. We determine any realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable debt securities on a\nspecific identification method, and we record such gains and losses as a component of OI&E.\nOur investments in marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with the related gains and losses,\nincluding unrealized, recognized in OI&E. We classify our marketable equity securities subject to long-term lock-up\nrestrictions beyond 12 months as other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNon-Marketable Securities\nNon-marketable securities primarily consist of equity securities. We account for non-marketable equity securities\nthrough which we exercise significant influence but do not have control over the investee under the equity method. All\nother non-marketable equity securities that we hold are primarily accounted for under the measurement alternative.\nUnder the measurement alternative, the carrying value is measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus\n59."

The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or\nservices and customers, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer.\nAdditionally, accounts receivable includes amounts for services performed in advance of the right to invoice the\ncustomer.\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable, which is recorded as an offset to accounts\nreceivable, and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements\nof Income. We assess collectibility by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics\nexist and on an individual basis when we identify specific customers with known disputes or collectibility issues. In\ndetermining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we consider historical collectibility based on past due status\nand make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also consider\ncustomer-specific information, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic\nconditions.\nOther\nOur financial instruments also include debt and equity investments in companies with which we also entered into\ncommercial arrangements at or near the same time. For these transactions, judgment is required in assessing the\nsubstance of the arrangements, including assessing whether the components of the arrangements should be\naccounted for as separate transactions under the applicable GAAP, and determining the value of the components of\nthe arrangements, including the fair value of the investments. Additionally, if our investment in such companies\nbecomes impaired, any remaining performance obligations would be reassessed and may be reduced.\nImpairment of Investments\nWe periodically review our debt and non-marketable equity securities for impairment.\nFor debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists. The credit loss is\nestimated by considering available information relevant to the collectibility of the security and information about past\nevents, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Any credit loss is recorded as a charge to OI&E,\nnot to exceed the amount of the unrealized loss. Unrealized losses other than the credit loss are recognized in AOCI. If\nwe have an intent to sell, or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a debt security in an unrealized\nloss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis, we will write down the security to its fair value and record the\ncorresponding charge as a component of OI&E.\nFor non-marketable equity securities, including equity method investments, we consider whether impairment\nindicators exist by evaluating the companies' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among\nother indicators. If the assessment indicates that the investment is impaired, we write down the investment to its fair\nvalue by recording the corresponding charge as a component of OI&E. We prepare quantitative measurements of the\nfair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income approach.\nInventory\nInventory consists primarily of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is\ncomputed using the first-in, first-out method.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in\nwhich we have other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity (VIE). We consolidate VIEs when we are\nthe primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have the power to direct activities that most\nsignificantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses\n60."

If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a\nVIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.\nPeriodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination\nof whether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment includes the following categories: land and buildings, information technology assets,\nconstruction in progress, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures. Land and buildings include land, offices,\ndata centers, and related building improvements. Information technology assets include servers and network\nequipment. Construction in progress is the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet\nbeen placed in service.\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recorded using the\nstraight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which we regularly evaluate. Land is not depreciated.\nWe depreciate buildings over periods of seven to 25 years. We depreciate information technology assets generally\nover a period of six years for servers and network equipment. We depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter\nof the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation for buildings, information\ntechnology assets, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures commences once they are ready for our\nintended use.\nGoodwill\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. We\nevaluate our reporting units periodically, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in\nreporting units, we reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. We test our goodwill for\nimpairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be\nimpaired. Goodwill impairments were not material for the periods presented.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-\nlease components. Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed. Non-lease components primarily\ninclude payments for maintenance and utilities. We combine fixed payments for non-lease components with lease\npayments and account for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets\nand liabilities.\nCertain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the\nlease assets and liabilities. These amounts primarily include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index, and\npayments for maintenance and utilities.\nLease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease\ncommencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our\nincremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable. Our incremental\nborrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments,\nand in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Our lease terms include periods under options to\nextend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally use the\nbase, non-cancelable, lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. Lease assets also include any\nprepaid lease payments and lease incentives.\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The current portion of our\noperating lease liabilities is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and the long-term portion is\nincluded in operating lease liabilities. Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment, net. Finance lease\nliabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or long-term debt.\nOperating lease expense (excluding variable lease costs) is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease\nterm.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review leases, property and equipment, and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment when\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed\nat the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. We measure recoverability of these assets by\ncomparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected\n61."

If the carrying value of the assets or asset group is not recoverable, the impairment recognized is\nmeasured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which we recognize the amount of taxes\npayable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of\nevents that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We measure current and deferred tax\nassets and liabilities based on provisions of enacted tax law. We evaluate the likelihood of future realization of our\ndeferred tax assets based on all available evidence and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets\nwhen it is more likely than not that they will not be realized or release a valuation allowance to increase deferred tax\nassets when it is more likely than not that they will be realized. We have elected to account for the tax effects of the\nglobal intangible low tax Income provision as a current period expense.\nWe recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that, based on\ntechnical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The tax benefits of the position recognized in the\nfinancial statements are then measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be\nrealized upon settlement with a taxing authority. In addition, we recognize interest and penalties related to\nunrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the acquisition date. We allocate the\npurchase price of the acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values,\nexcept for revenue contracts acquired, which are recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The\nexcess of the purchase price over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\nForeign Currency\nWe translate the financial statements of our international subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange\nrates for assets and liabilities, and average rates for the annual period derived from month-end exchange rates for\nrevenues, costs, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in AOCI as a component of stockholders\u2019\nequity. We reflect net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction\ncurrency to functional currency as a component of foreign currency exchange gain (loss) in OI&E.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Standards Accounting Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update\n(ASU) 2023-07 \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280):Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\" which expands\nannual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about\nsignificant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2024, and for\ninterim periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential\neffect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 \"Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures\" to expand the disclosure requirements for income taxes, specifically related to the rate reconciliation and\nincome taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption\npermitted.

These inputs significantly vary based on\ninvestment type. The fair value of non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment are\nclassified within Level 3.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $28.8 billion, of which\n$13.7 billion were remeasured at fair value during the year ended December 31, 2023, and primarily classified within\nLevel 2 of the fair value hierarchy at the time of measurement.\n65."

The primary risk\nmanaged is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings,\nand investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We\nalso enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance investment returns.\nWe recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the derivatives\nprimarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy comprised of a\ncombination of purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at gross fair values.\nThe accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation.\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge\ncertain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have\nmaturities of 24 months or less.\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and\nsubsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points and\ntime value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life of the\nhedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the\namount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect\nwas $47 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.\nFair Value Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our\nmarketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in the\nassessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OI&E, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the related\nhedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the\nexcluded component in OI&E.\nNet Investment Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks\nrelated to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude forward\npoints from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in OI&E.\nOther Derivatives\nWe enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to\nhedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the\nfunctional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting\nhedges are primarily recorded in OI&E along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and\nliabilities.\nWe also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates,\ncommodity prices, credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns. From time to time, we enter into derivatives to\nhedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains and losses arising from other\nderivatives are primarily reflected within the \u201cother\u201d component of OI&E. See Note 7 for further details.\n68."

Commitments and Contingencies\nCommitments\nWe have content licensing agreements with future fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments of $10.6 billion as\nof December 31, 2023, of which the majority is paid over seven years ending in the first quarter of 2030.\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate\nactivities, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network partners, distribution partners,\ncustomers of Google Cloud offerings, lessors, and service providers with respect to certain matters. We have agreed\nto defend and/or hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or\nout of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit\nthe time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered\ninto indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification\nobligations to our agents.\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification\nagreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the\npayments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations,\ncash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future\npayments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows\nin a particular period.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably\npossible.\nLegal Matters\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be\nreasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be\nestimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect\nthe amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses\ndisclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.\nCertain outstanding matters seek speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts, substantial\nchanges to our business practices and products, or structural remedies. Significant judgment is required to determine\nboth the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and we may be\nunable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of outstanding legal matters are\ninherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either individually or in aggregate, have a\nmaterial adverse effect.\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\n77."

The EC decision imposed a \u20ac2.4\nbillion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision to the General\nCourt, and on September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into compliance with the\nEC's decision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2017. On November 10,\n2021, the General Court rejected our appeal, and we subsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice\non January 20, 2022.\nOn July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google\u2019s Android-related distribution\nagreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a \u20ac4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30,\n2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision, and\non October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution practices. On September 14,\n2022, the General Court reduced the fine from \u20ac4.3 billion to \u20ac4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal with the\nEuropean Court of Justice. In 2018, we recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by\n$217 million in 2022.\nOn March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that Google\nhad with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a fine of \u20ac1.5\nbillion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners' agreements,\nwhich we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed the EC decision. We recognized a charge\nof $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019.\nFrom time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on various competition\nmatters by regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally. Examples, for which given their\nnature we cannot estimate a possible loss, include:\n\u2022 In August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)\nrequesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our\nbusiness. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the\nDistrict of Columbia on October 20, 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search\nand Search advertising. The trial ended on November 16, 2023, and we expect a decision in 2024. Further, in\nJune 2022, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the United Kingdom's\nCompetition and Markets Authority (CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\n\u2022 On December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state\ndeceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology, and a trial is scheduled for March 2025. Additionally,\non January 24, 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state Attorneys General, filed an antitrust complaint in\nthe U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging that Google\u2019s digital advertising technology\nproducts violate U.S. antitrust laws, and on April 17, 2023, a number of additional state Attorneys General\njoined the complaint. The EC, the CMA, and the ACCC each opened a formal investigation into Google's\nadvertising technology business practices on June 22, 2021, May 25, 2022, and June 29, 2022, respectively.\nOn June 14, 2023, the EC issued a Statement of Objections (SO) informing Google of its preliminary view that\nGoogle violated European antitrust laws relating to its advertising technology. We responded to the SO on\nDecember 1, 2023.\n\u2022 On July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for\nthe Northern District of California, alleging that Google\u2019s operation of Android and Google Play violated U.S.\nantitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In September 2023, we reached a settlement\nin principle with 50 state Attorneys General and three territories. The U.S. District Court subsequently vacated\nthe trial date with the states, and any final approval of the settlement is expected to occur in 2024. In May\n2022, the EC and the CMA each opened investigations into Google Play\u2019s business practices. Korean\nregulators are investigating Google Play's billing practices, including a formal review in May 2022 of Google's\ncompliance with the new app store billing regulations.\nWe believe we have strong arguments against these claims and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue to\ncooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\n78."

            "text": "Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\nPrivacy Matters\nWe are subject to a number of privacy-related laws and regulations, and we currently are party to a number of\nprivacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. For example, there are ongoing investigations and\nlitigation in the U.S. and the EU, including those relating to our collection and use of location information and\nadvertising practices, which could result in significant fines, judgments, and product changes.\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these\nlawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders\npreventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change\nour business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for\nus and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly\nbecome an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can\nresult in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a\nprohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important\nproducts into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against\ncertain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims,\nand may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our\ncustomers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions\nor otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\nOther\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent\norders involving competition, intellectual property, data security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment,\ncommercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using\nour platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, in December 2023, a California\njury delivered a verdict in Epic Games v. Google finding that Google violated antitrust laws related to Google Play's\nbusiness. The presiding judge will determine remedies in 2024, and the range of potential remedies vary widely. We\nplan to appeal. We also periodically have data incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law.\nThese claims, consent orders, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings could\nresult in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our\nproducts and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other\nadverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, civil judgments that include compounding\npenalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including\nthose of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.\nNon-Income Taxes\nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The\nsubject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the\nsale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We accrue\nnon-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when\na loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of\nloss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of\nthese matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially different from our\nexpectations.\nSee, Note 14 for information regarding income tax contingencies.\n79."

            "text": "Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\nNote 11. Stockholders' Equity\nClass A and Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock\nOur Board of Directors has authorized three classes of stock, Class A and Class B common stock, and Class C\ncapital stock. The rights of the holders of each class of our common and capital stock are identical, except with respect\nto voting. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock\nis entitled to 10 votes per share. Class C capital stock has no voting rights, except as required by applicable law.\nShares of Class B common stock may be converted at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically\nconvert upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock.\nShare Repurchases\nIn the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023, we repurchased $50.3 billion, $59.3 billion, and\n$62.2 billion, respectively, of Alphabet's Class A and Class C shares.\nIn April 2023, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional\n$70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares. As of December 31, 2023, $36.3 billion remains available for Class A\nand Class C share repurchases.\nThe following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 Year Ended December 31, 2023\nShares Amount Shares Amount\nClass A share repurchases 61 $ 6,719 78 $ 9,316\nClass C share repurchases 469 52,577 450 52,868\nTotal share repurchases(1) 530 $ 59,296 528 $ 62,184\n(1) Shares repurchased include unsettled repurchases as of December 31, 2023.\nClass A and Class C shares are repurchased in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its\nstockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading\nprices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. Repurchases are executed from time to time, subject to\ngeneral business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or\nprivately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an\nexpiration date.\nNote 12. Net Income Per Share\nWe compute net income per share of Class A, Class B, and Class C stock using the two-class method. Basic net\nincome per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net\nincome per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutive\nsecurities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of RSUs and other contingently issuable\nshares. The dilutive effect of outstanding RSUs and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings\nper share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A\nstock assumes the conversion of Class B stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B stock does not\nassume the conversion of those shares.\nThe rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock\nare identical, except with respect to voting. Furthermore, there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of\nincorporation, as well as Delaware law, which preclude our Board of Directors from declaring or paying unequal per\nshare dividends on our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. Specifically, Delaware law provides that amendments to\nour certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a\ngiven class of stock must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment. In\naddition, our certificate of incorporation provides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder vote, it\nmust be approved by the unanimous consent of our Board of Directors. As a result, the undistributed earnings for each\nyear are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A, Class B, and Class C stock as if the\nearnings for the year had been distributed. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed\nearnings are allocated on a proportionate basis.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023, the net income per share amounts are the same for\nClass A, Class B, and Class C stock because the holders of each class are entitled to equal per share dividends or\ndistributions in liquidation in accordance with the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Alphabet Inc.\n80."

A cumulative one-time adjustment applicable to the prior period for\nthese tax rule changes was recorded in 2023.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets\nand liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components\nof our deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows (in millions):\nAs of December 31,\n2022 2023\nDeferred tax assets:\nAccrued employee benefits $ 955 $ 1,855\nAccruals and reserves not currently deductible 1,956 2,481\nTax credits 6,002 6,609\nNet operating losses 2,557 2,965\nOperating leases 2,711 3,526\nCapitalized research and development(1) 10,381 17,757\nOther 2,289 1,951\nTotal deferred tax assets 26,851 37,144\nValuation allowance (9,553) (10,999)\nTotal deferred tax assets net of valuation allowance 17,298 26,145\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nProperty and equipment, net (6,607) (8,189)\nNet investment gains (2,361) (2,405)\nOperating leases (2,491) (2,965)\nOther (1,092) (902)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities (12,551) (14,461)\nNet deferred tax assets (liabilities) $ 4,747 $ 11,684\n(1) As required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, effective January 1, 2022, our research and development expenditures were\ncapitalized and amortized which resulted in substantially higher cash taxes starting in 2022 with an equal amount of deferred\ntax benefit.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax\npurposes were approximately $7.1 billion, $18.6 billion, and $1.8 billion respectively.

It is more likely than not that the\nmajority of the net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized; therefore, we have recorded a valuation allowance\nagainst them. The net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various annual limitations under the tax laws of the\ndifferent jurisdictions.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our Federal and California research and development credit carryforwards for income\ntax purposes were approximately $600 million and $6.3 billion, respectively. If not utilized, the Federal R&D credit will\nbegin to expire in 2037 and the California R&D credit can be carried over indefinitely. We believe the majority of the\nfederal tax credit and state tax credit is not likely to be realized.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our investment tax credit carryforwards for state income tax purposes were\napproximately $1.0 billion and will begin to expire in 2029. We use the flow-through method of accounting for\ninvestment tax credits. We believe this tax credit is not likely to be realized.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we maintained a valuation allowance with respect to California deferred tax assets,\ncertain federal net operating losses, certain state net operating losses and tax credits, net deferred tax assets relating\nto Other Bet companies, and certain foreign net operating losses that we believe are not likely to be realized. We\ncontinue to reassess the remaining valuation allowance quarterly, and if future evidence allows for a partial or full\nrelease of the valuation allowance, a tax benefit will be recorded accordingly.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to our gross unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021 2022 2023\nBeginning gross unrecognized tax benefits $ 3,837 $ 5,158 $ 7,055\nIncreases related to prior year tax positions 529 253 740\nDecreases related to prior year tax positions (263) (437) (682)\nDecreases related to settlement with tax authorities (329) (140) (21)\nIncreases related to current year tax positions 1,384 2,221 2,346\nEnding gross unrecognized tax benefits $ 5,158 $ 7,055 $ 9,438\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating\nour uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. The total amount of gross unrecognized tax\nbenefits was $5.2 billion, $7.1 billion, and $9.4 billion as of December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively, of which\n$3.7 billion, $5.3 billion, and $7.4 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2023, we accrued $346 million and $622 million in interest and penalties in\nprovision for income taxes, respectively.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. Our two\nmajor tax jurisdictions are the U.S. federal and Ireland. We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax\nreturns by the IRS and other tax authorities. The IRS is currently examining our 2016 through 2021 tax returns. We\nhave also received tax assessments in multiple foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or\npermanent establishment. We continue to defend such claims as presented.\nThe tax years 2016 through 2022 remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for\nIrish tax purposes. There are other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial\nstatements.\nWe regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the\nadequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax\nauthorities and the effect, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions.\nWe believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.\nHowever, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are\nresolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for\nincome taxes in the period such resolutions occur. Although the timing of resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is\nnot certain, it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits from certain U.S. federal, state, and non U.S.\ntax positions could decrease by approximately $700 million in the next 12 months. Positions that may be resolved\ninclude various U.S. and non-U.S. matters.\n85."

Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; fees\nreceived for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and\nNFL Sunday Ticket; the sale of apps and in-app purchases and devices.\n\u2022 Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for\nenterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from consumption-based fees and\nsubscriptions received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and\ncollaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\n\u2022 Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from\nOther Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.\nRevenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering\nactivities, and devices, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the\nintegrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are\nmanaged centrally at a consolidated level. These costs, including the associated depreciation and impairment, are\nallocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage, headcount, or revenue.\nReflecting DeepMind's increasing collaboration with Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets, beginning in\nthe first quarter of 2023 DeepMind is reported as part of Alphabet-level activities instead of within Other Bets.\nAdditionally, beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we updated and simplified our cost allocation methodologies to\nprovide our business leaders with increased transparency for decision-making. Prior periods have been recast to\nconform to the current presentation.\nAs announced on April 20, 2023, we brought together part of Google Research (the Brain team) and DeepMind to\nsignificantly accelerate our progress in artificial intelligence (AI). The group, called Google DeepMind, is reported within\nAlphabet-level activities prospectively beginning in the second quarter of 2023. Previously, the Brain team was\nincluded within Google Services.\nCertain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs\nprimarily include AI-focused shared R&D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; corporate\ninitiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and\nlegal costs, including certain fines and settlements. Charges associated with reductions in our workforce and office\nspace during 2023 were not allocated to our segments.

BUSINESS\nOverview\nAs our founders Larry and Sergey wrote in the original founders' letter, \"Google is not a conventional company.\nWe do not intend to become one.\" That unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history, inspiring\nus to tackle big problems and invest in moonshots. It led us to be a pioneer in the development of AI and, since 2016,\nan AI-first company. We continue this work under the leadership of Alphabet and Google CEO, Sundar Pichai.\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses \u2014 the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments,\nGoogle Services and Google Cloud, and all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Supporting these\nbusinesses, we have centralized certain AI-related research and development which is reported in Alphabet-level\nactivities. Alphabet's structure is about helping each of our businesses prosper through strong leaders and\nindependence.\nAccess and Technology for Everyone\nThe Internet is one of the world\u2019s most powerful equalizers; it propels ideas, people, and businesses large and\nsmall. Our mission to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant\ntoday as it was when we were founded in 1998. Since then, we have evolved from a company that helps people find\nanswers to a company that also helps people get things done.\nWe are focused on building an even more helpful Google for everyone, and we aspire to give everyone the tools\nthey need to increase their knowledge, health, happiness, and success. Google Search helps people find information\nand make sense of the world in more natural and intuitive ways, with trillions of searches on Google every year.\nYouTube provides people with entertainment, information, and opportunities to learn something new and helps support\nthe creator economy through the YouTube Partner Program. Google Cloud helps customers solve today\u2019s business\nchallenges, improve productivity, reduce costs, and unlock new growth engines. We are continually innovating and\nbuilding new products and features to help our users, partners, customers, and communities and have invested more\nthan $150 billion in research and development in the last five years in support of these efforts.\n4."

At Google, we have been bringing AI into our products and services for\nmore than a decade and making them available to our users.\nIn 2023, we took a significant step on our journey to make AI more helpful for everyone with the introduction of\nGemini, our natively multimodal AI model. In 2024, we launched Gemini 2.0, our most capable model yet. Gemini can\ngeneralize and seamlessly understand, operate across, and combine different types of information including text, code,\naudio, image, and video. Gemini is powering AI features across our products and services that are helping people\neveryday. Today, all seven of our two billion-user products \u2014 Android, Chrome, Gmail, Maps, Play Store, Search, and\nYouTube \u2014 are using Gemini.\nOur Google Cloud products, including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, help organizations stay at\nthe forefront of innovation with our AI-optimized infrastructure, AI development platform, world-class models, as well as\nassistive agents and applications.\nWe believe AI has the potential to solve important societal, scientific, and engineering challenges. For example, in\n2020, Google DeepMind\u2019s AlphaFold system solved a 50-year-old protein folding challenge, and in 2024, we\nintroduced AlphaFold 3, built on the previous models, to predict the structure and interactions of all the molecules in\nlife's processes.\nWe are focused on transforming our products to provide the most helpful tools to our users and customers as we\ndeliver on our mission to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful.\nDeliver the Most Advanced, Safe, and Responsible AI\nWe aim to build the most advanced, safe, and responsible AI through a full stack of robust AI-optimized\ninfrastructure, including data centers, chips, and a global fiber network; world class research teams; and a broad global\nreach through products and platforms that touch billions of people and customers around the world.\nWe are driving efficiencies in our data centers, while making significant hardware and model improvements. For\nexample, since we started serving AI Overviews to our users, we have significantly lowered machine costs and latency\nthrough hardware, engineering, and technical breakthroughs. Our AI-optimized infrastructure allows us to use, and\noffer our customers, a range of AI accelerator options, including our own custom-built Tensor Processing Units (TPUs).\nOur teams across Alphabet leverage Gemini, as well as other AI models we have previously developed and\nannounced, to deliver the best product and service experiences for our users, advertisers, partners, customers, and\ndevelopers. We are using Gemini 2.0 in new research prototypes, including Project Astra, which explores the future\ncapabilities of a universal AI assistant and Project Mariner, an early prototype capable of taking actions in Chrome as\nan experimental extension.\nWe believe our approach to AI must be both bold and responsible. That means developing AI in a way that\nmaximizes the positive benefits to society while addressing its potential challenges, guided by our AI Principles.\nEnable Organizations and Developers to Innovate on Google Cloud\nAI is a major technology shift for enterprises. Globally, businesses from startups to large enterprises, and the\npublic sector are thinking about how to drive transformation. That is why we are focused on making it easy and\nscalable for others to innovate, and grow, with AI. That means providing advanced computing infrastructure and\nexpanding access to Google\u2019s latest AI models. Our Vertex AI platform gives developers the ability to train, tune,\naugment, test, and deploy applications using Gemini, Imagen, Veo, and other generative AI models. Gemini for Google\nCloud provides pre-packaged AI agents that can assist developers to write, document, test, and operate software as\nwell as assist cybersecurity teams to analyze, detect, protect, and respond to threats.\nImprove Knowledge, Learning, Creativity, and Productivity\nAs AI continues to improve rapidly, we are focused on transforming our products to provide our users the most\nhelpful tools. Examples include AI Overviews, which allow users to ask their most complex questions, break down\nconcepts in a format that is useful for them, or take a video and ask a question out loud, and NotebookLM, which helps\nusers understand complex information by summarizing sources and providing relevant quotes. We are embedding the\npower of generative AI to continue helping our users express themselves and get things done. For example, the\nGemini app allows users to collaborate with new AI features that include image generation capabilities, coding support,\nand app integration. Gemini for Google Workspace helps users write, organize, visualize, accelerate workflows, and\nhave richer meetings. Additionally, we are using Gemini to improve recommendations on YouTube. We also know\nbusinesses of all sizes around the world rely on Google Ads to find customers and grow their businesses \u2014 and we\n5."

For example, advertisers are able to use our updated image generation in Google Ads\nto produce high-quality imagery for their campaigns, and Demand Gen helps them reach their target audiences.\nBuild the Most Helpful Personal Computing Platforms and Devices\nOver the years, our Pixel phones have incorporated AI compute directly into the device and built experiences on\ntop of it. Our latest Pixel devices were built with Gemini Nano, bringing the best AI-assistive experiences to our users,\nsuch as Gemini on Pixel, Pixel Screenshots, and Pixel Studio. Our Android and Chrome operating systems enable\nusers to access Gemini, and other Google AI features throughout their day. For example, with Circle to Search built\ndirectly into the Android experience, users can search anything they see on their phone using a simple gesture.\nMoonshots\nMany companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This\nincrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not\nevolutionary. Our acquisitions of YouTube and Android and subsequent launch of Chrome have matured into major\nplatforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer, popular browser. In Other Bets, our fully autonomous driving\ntechnology company, Waymo, is now providing fully autonomous, paid ride-hailing services to customers in multiple\ncities.\nOur early investments in AI started out as moonshots but are now incorporated into our core products and central\nto future developments. We continue to look toward the future and to invest for the long term, most notably for the\napplication of AI to our products and services, as well as other frontier technologies such as quantum computing. As\nwe said in the original founders' letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in, as\nthey are the key to our long-term success.\nPrivacy and Security\nWe make it a priority to protect the privacy and security of our products, users, and customers, even if there are\nnear-term financial consequences. We do this by continuously investing in building products that are secure by default;\nstrictly upholding responsible data practices that emphasize privacy by design; and building easy-to-use settings that\nput people in control. We are continually enhancing these efforts over time, whether by enabling users to auto-delete\ntheir data, applying privacy technologies like on-device processing, giving people tools to control their experience, or\nadvancing anti-malware, anti-phishing, and password security features.\nGoogle\nFor reporting purposes Google comprises two segments: Google Services and Google Cloud.\nGoogle Services\nServing Our Users\nWe have always been committed to building helpful products that can improve the lives of millions of people\nworldwide. Our product innovations are what make our services widely used, and our brand one of the most\nrecognized in the world. Google Services' core products and platforms include ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Gmail,\nGoogle Drive, Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Play, Search, and YouTube, with broad and growing adoption by\nusers around the world.\nOur products and services have come a long way since the company was founded more than 25 years ago.\nWhile Google Search started as a way to find web pages, organized into ten blue links, we have driven technical\nadvancements and product innovations that have transformed Google Search into a dynamic, multimodal experience.\nWe first expanded from traditional desktop browsers into mobile web search, making it easier to navigate on smaller\nscreens. As new types of content surfaced on the internet, Universal Search made it possible to search multiple\ncontent types, like news, images, videos, and more, to deliver rich, relevant results. The introduction of new search\nmodalities, like voice and visual search, made it easier for people to express their curiosity in natural and intuitive\nways. We took that a step further with multisearch, which lets people search with text and images at the same time.\nLarge language models have made it possible to express more natural language queries, vastly improving the types of\nquestions users can ask, and the quality of results. Each advancement has made it easier and more natural for people\nto find what they are looking for. We are now using Gemini customized for Google Search to provide our users an\nimproved Search experience, and AI Overviews has been released in more than one hundred countries, reaching more\nthan one billion users.\nThis drive to make information more accessible and helpful has led us over the years to improve the discovery\nand creation of digital content both on the web and through platforms like Google Play and YouTube. People are\nconsuming many forms of digital content, including watching videos, streaming TV, playing games, listening to music,\n6."

This potential is reflected in our latest generation of devices,\nsuch as the new Pixel 9 series and the Pixel Watch 3. Creating products and services that people rely on every day is\na journey that we are investing in for the long-term.\nHow We Make Money\nWe have built world-class advertising technologies for advertisers, agencies, and publishers to power their digital\nmarketing businesses. Our advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses through our wide\nrange of products across devices and formats, and we aim to ensure positive user experiences by serving the right ads\nat the right time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies. AI has been foundational to our\nadvertising business for more than a decade. Products like Demand Gen, Performance Max, and Product Studio use\nthe full power of our AI to help advertisers find untapped and incremental conversion opportunities.\nGoogle Services generates revenues primarily by delivering both performance and brand advertising that appears\non Google Search & other properties, YouTube, and Google Network partners' properties (\"Google Network\nproperties\"). We continue to invest in both performance and brand advertising and seek to improve the measurability of\nadvertising so advertisers understand the effectiveness of their campaigns.\n\u2022 Performance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click on leading to direct\nengagement with advertisers. Performance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while driving\nmeasurable results. Our ads tools allow performance advertisers to create simple text-based ads.\n\u2022 Brand advertising helps enhance users' awareness of and affinity for advertisers' products and services,\nthrough videos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across various devices. We help brand\nadvertisers deliver digital videos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their brand-building marketing\ncampaigns.\nWe have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web.\nWe focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways, including filtering\nout invalid traffic, removing billions of bad ads from our systems every year, and closely monitoring the sites, apps, and\nvideos where ads appear and blocklisting them when necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content.\nIn addition, Google Services increasingly generates revenues from products and services beyond advertising,\nincluding:\n\u2022 consumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such as YouTube TV,\nYouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;\n\u2022 platforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play sales of apps and in-app purchases; and\n\u2022 devices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices.\nGoogle Cloud\nThrough our Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace offerings, Google Cloud generates revenues\nprimarily from consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, applications, and other cloud\nservices. Customers use Google Cloud in multiple ways such as:\n\u2022 AI-optimized Infrastructure: provides open, reliable, and scalable compute, networking, and storage to\nenable customers to run workloads anywhere \u2014 on our Cloud, at the edge, or in their data centers. It can be\nused to migrate and modernize IT systems and to train and serve various types of AI models.\n\u2022 Developer Platform: provides developers, through the Vertex AI platform, the ability to train, tune, augment,\ntest, and deploy applications using Gemini and other leading generative AI models. We offer widely used first-\nparty, third-party, and open models along with services such as vector search, grounding, and distillation to\nfurther improve the cost and quality of models.\n\u2022 Cybersecurity: provides AI powered cybersecurity solutions to help customers analyze, detect, protect, and\nrespond to a broad range of cybersecurity threats, to further strengthen security outcomes, prioritize which\nthreats to investigate, and identify attack paths, as well as accelerate resolution of cybersecurity threats.\n7."

Now, Gemini for Google\nWorkspace brings our AI-powered agents into Gmail, Docs, Sheets and more to help users write, organize,\nvisualize, accelerate workflows, and have richer meetings.\nOther Bets\nAcross Alphabet, we are also using technology to try to solve big problems that affect a wide variety of industries,\nincluding transportation and health technology. Alphabet\u2019s investment in the portfolio of Other Bets includes businesses\nthat are at various stages of development, ranging from those in the R&D phase to those that are in the beginning\nstages of commercialization. Our goal is for them to become thriving, successful businesses. Other Bets operate as\nindependent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent members and outside investors.\nWhile these early-stage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty, some of them are already generating\nrevenue and making important strides in their industries.

To make progress toward this effort, we aim to reduce 50% of our combined Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based),\nand Scope 3 absolute emissions (compared to our 2019 base year) by 2030, and we plan to invest in nature-based\nand technology-based carbon removal solutions to neutralize our remaining emissions.\nOur primary approach to reducing our Scope 2 emissions is through the procurement of carbon-free energy\n(CFE). In 2020, we set a goal to run on 24/7 CFE every hour of every day on every grid where we operate by 2030. In\n2023, we began implementing our carbon removals strategy, and we have begun establishing impactful partnerships\nand have started contracting for carbon removal credits.\nAchieving net-zero emissions and 24/7 CFE by 2030 are extremely ambitious goals. We also know that our path\nto net-zero emissions will not be easy or linear. Some of our plans may take years to deliver results, particularly where\nthey involve building new large-scale infrastructure with long lead times. Our approach will continue to evolve and will\nrequire us to navigate significant uncertainty, including the uncertainty around the future environmental impact of AI,\nwhich is complex and difficult to predict. In addition, solutions for some key global challenges do not currently exist,\nand will depend heavily on the development and improvement of new technologies by us and by the energy sector. As\nour business and industry continue to evolve, we expect our total GHG emissions to rise before dropping toward our\nabsolute emissions reduction target.\nFor additional information about risks and uncertainties applicable to our work on sustainability and efficiency, see\nItem 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCulture and Workforce\nWe are a company of curious, talented, and passionate people.

They can use their experience and resources\nin ways that could affect our competitive position, including by making acquisitions and entering into other strategic\narrangements; continuing to invest heavily in technical infrastructure, R&D, and in talent; initiating intellectual property\nand competition claims (whether or not meritorious); and continuing to compete for users, advertisers, customers, and\ncontent providers. Further, discrepancies in enforcement of existing laws may enable our lesser known competitors to\naggressively interpret those laws without commensurate scrutiny, thereby affording them competitive advantages. Our\ncompetitors may also be able to innovate and provide products and services faster or more cost effectively than we\ncan or may foresee the need for products and services before we do.\nWe are expanding our investment in AI across the entire company. This includes generative AI and continuing to\nintegrate AI capabilities into our products and services. AI technology and services are highly competitive, rapidly\nevolving, and require significant investment, including technical infrastructure, development and operational costs, to\nmeet the changing needs and expectations of our existing users and attract new users. Our ability to deploy certain AI\ntechnologies critical for our products and services and for our business strategy may depend on the availability and\npricing of third-party equipment and other technical infrastructure operations costs, including network capacity, energy,\nand equipment costs. Additionally, other companies may develop AI products and technologies that are similar or\nsuperior to our technologies or more cost-effective to develop and/or deploy. Other companies may also have (or in the\nfuture may obtain) patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit, or interfere with our ability to make, use,\nor sell our own AI products and services.\nOur financial condition and operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive in a\ntimely manner to the evolving needs and desires of our users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content\nproviders, or if we miscalculate those needs and desires and invest significantly in areas that fail to gain sufficient\nmarket traction. As new and existing technologies continue to develop, competitors and new entrants may be able to\noffer experiences that are, or that are perceived to be, substantially similar to or better than ours. These technologies\ncould reduce usage of our products and services, and force us to compete in different ways and expend significant\nresources to develop and operate equal or better products and services. Competitors\u2019 success in providing compelling\nproducts and services or in attracting and retaining users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers\ncould harm our financial condition and operating results.\nOur ongoing investment in new businesses, products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and\ncould divert management attention and harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services, and technologies in a\nwide range of industries beyond online advertising.

Our\ninvestments ultimately may not be commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital and, in\npursuing new strategies, we may incur unanticipated liabilities.\nWe have invested significantly and expect to continue to invest significantly in our property and equipment,\nincluding our technical infrastructure, and we expect these assets to benefit our business over their estimated useful\nlives. Changes in facts and circumstances such as changes to ongoing business operations, changes in the planned\nuse and utilization of assets, and/or technological advancements, could indicate a change in the period over which we\nexpect to benefit from the asset and impact our financial condition and operating results.\nInnovations in our products and services could also result in changes to user behavior and affect our revenue\ntrends. These endeavors involve significant risks and uncertainties, including diversion of resources and management\nattention from current operations, different monetization models, and the use of alternative investment, governance, or\ncompensation structures that may fail to adequately align incentives across the company or otherwise accomplish their\nobjectives.\nWithin Google Services, we continue to invest heavily in devices, including our smartphones, home devices, and\nwearables, which is a highly competitive market with frequent introduction of new products and services, rapid\nadoption of technological advancements by competitors, increased market saturation in developed countries, short\nproduct life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in performance characteristics, and price and\nfeature sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. There can be no assurance we will be able to provide\ndevices that compete effectively.\nWithin Google Cloud, we devote significant resources to develop and deploy our enterprise-ready cloud services,\nincluding Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, and we are advancing our AI platforms and models to\nsupport these tools and technologies. We are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud\ncomputing services, invest in cybersecurity, and hire talent, particularly to support and scale our sales force. At the\nsame time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services. Pricing, including platform\nswitching costs, are challenging across the industry, and delivery models are competitive and constantly evolving, and\nwe may therefore not achieve our business objectives. Further, our business with financial services, healthcare, and\npublic sector customers may present additional risks, including regulatory compliance risks. For instance, we may be\nsubject to government audits and cost reviews, and any failure to comply or any deficiencies found may expose us to\nlegal, financial, and/or reputational risks. Evolving laws and regulations may require us to make new capital\ninvestments, build new products, and seek partners to deliver localized services in other countries, and we may not be\nable to meet sovereign operating requirements.\nWithin Other Bets, we are investing significantly in areas such as health, life sciences, and transportation, among\nothers. These investment areas face intense competition from large, experienced, and well-funded competitors, and\nour offerings, many of which involve the development of new and emerging technologies, may not be successful, or be\nable to compete effectively or operate at sufficient levels of profitability.\nIn addition, new and evolving products and services, including those that use AI, raise ethical, technological,\nlegal, regulatory, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and\nservices. Because all of these investment areas are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies\nand offerings will be successful or will not harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time, and we may experience downward pressure on our\noperating margin in the future.\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including changes in the\ndevices and modalities used to access our products and services; changes in geographic mix; deceleration or declines\nin advertiser spending; competition; changes in customer usage and demand for our existing products and increasing\ndemand for new technologies; decreases in the pricing of our products and services; ongoing product and policy\nchanges; and shifts to lower priced products and services.\nIn addition, we may experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from a variety of factors,\nsuch as an increase in the mix of lower-margin products and services, in particular from the continued expansion of our\nbusiness into new fields, including products and services such as our devices, Google Cloud, and consumer\nsubscription products, as well as significant investments in Other Bets, all of which may have margins lower than those\nwe generate from advertising. In particular, margins on our devices have had, and may continue to have, an adverse\neffect on our consolidated margins due to pressures on pricing and higher cost of sales. We may also experience\ndownward pressure on our operating margins from increasing regulations, increasing competition, and increasing costs\n12."

Further, certain of our\ncosts and expenses are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. We may also\nnot be able to continue to execute our efficiency efforts successfully or in a timely manner. Due to these factors and the\nevolving nature of our business, our historical revenue growth rate and historical operating margin may not be\nindicative of our future performance. For additional information, see Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect and\nRevenues and Monetization Metrics in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of\nour products, services, and brands as well as affect our ability to compete.\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for\nus. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products,\nservices, and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country\nin which our products and services are distributed or made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have\ntaken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Although we seek to obtain patent protection\nfor our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Moreover, we may not have\nadequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. There is always the\npossibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or\nunenforceable.\nWe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy of such trade secrets and\nother sensitive information could be compromised, which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting\nfrom these trade secrets. We also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word\n\u201cGoogle\u201d could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word \u201csearch.\u201d Some courts have\nruled that \"Google\" is a protectable trademark, but it is possible that other courts, particularly those outside of the U.S.,\nmay reach a different determination. If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in\nother people using the word \u201cGoogle\u201d to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand.\nAny significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete.\nAlso, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of\nour intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our financial condition and operating\nresults.\nOur business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our\nability to expand our base of users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners.\nOur strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the\nbrands within Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch\nnew and innovative products and services that better serve the needs of our users, advertisers, customers, content\nproviders, and other partners. Our brands have been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by a number of\nfactors, including, among others, reputational issues, third-party content shared on our platforms, data privacy and\nsecurity issues and developments, and product or technical performance failures. For example, if we fail to respond\nappropriately to the sharing of misinformation or objectionable content on our services and/or products or objectionable\npractices by advertisers, or otherwise to adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence in our\nbrands.\nFurthermore, failure to maintain and enhance our brands could harm our business, reputation, financial condition,\nand operating results. Our success will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to\nprovide high-quality, trustworthy, innovative products and services that are truly useful and play a valuable role in a\nrange of settings.\nWe face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that could harm our business, financial\ncondition, and operating results.\nWe face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management, which could affect our ability\nto supply both our products and our services.\nWe rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture or assemble our devices as well as servers and networking\nequipment used in our technical infrastructure, certain components of which we may supply. We rely on third parties to\nsupply components and distribute our products and services. Our business could be negatively affected if we are not\nable to engage these companies with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we\nengage fail to meet their obligations (whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons), or make adverse changes\nin the pricing or other material terms of our arrangements with them.\n13."

Some of the components we use in our technical\ninfrastructure and our devices are available from only one or limited sources, and we may not be able to find\nreplacement vendors on favorable terms in the event of a supply chain disruption. A significant supply interruption that\naffects us or our vendors could delay critical data center upgrades or expansions and delay consumer product\navailability.\nWe may enter into long-term contracts for materials and products that commit us to significant terms and\nconditions. We may face costs for materials and products that are not consumed due to market demand, technological\nchange, changed consumer preferences, quality, product recalls, and warranty issues. For instance, because certain of\nour hardware supply contracts have volume-based pricing or minimum purchase requirements, if the volume of sales\nof our devices decreases or does not reach projected targets, we could face increased materials and manufacturing\ncosts or other financial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit to manufacture and harm our\nfinancial condition and operating results. Furthermore, certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable\ncontractual terms based on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and\nmay affect our supply. For example, industry supply capacity for AI accelerators, including Graphics Processing Units,\nor GPUs, as well as our custom-built TPUs, is highly competitive and rapidly evolving. If we are unable to negotiate\nfavorable contractual terms or our competitors claim the supply or capacity first, we may face supply constraints.\nOur devices have had, and in the future may have, quality issues resulting from design, manufacturing, or\noperations.

Their failure to procure necessary license rights to intellectual property\ncould affect our ability to sell our products or services and expose us to litigation or financial claims.\nInterruption to, interference with, or failure of our complex information technology and communications\nsystems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services, which could harm our\nreputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nThe availability of our products and services and fulfillment of our customer contracts depend on the continuing\noperation of our information technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable to damage,\ninterference, or interruption from modifications or upgrades, terrorist attacks, state-sponsored attacks, natural disasters\nor pandemics, geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, export controls and sanctions, the effects of climate change\n(such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutdowns\nassociated with wildfire prevention, and increased storm severity), power and transmission availability challenges,\nutility outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, software bugs, cyber attacks, supply-chain attacks,\ncomputer denial of service attacks, phishing schemes, or other attempts to harm or access our systems. Some of our\ndata centers are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes or other natural disasters. Our data centers are\nalso subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism, and, in some cases, to potential disruptions\nresulting from problems experienced by facility operators or disruptions as a result of geopolitical tensions and conflicts\nhappening in the area. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and disaster recovery planning cannot account for\nall eventualities. The occurrence of a natural disaster or pandemic, closure of a facility, or other unanticipated problems\naffecting our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, our products and services are\nhighly technical and complex and have contained in the past, and may contain in the future, errors or vulnerabilities,\nwhich could result in interruptions in or failure of our services or systems.

Although we\nhedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S.\ndollar and foreign currencies have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our revenues and earnings.\nHedging programs are also inherently risky and could expose us to additional risks that could harm our financial\ncondition and operating results.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in the fair values of our investments and, in some instances, our financial\nstatements incorporate inherently subjective valuation methodologies.\nThe fair value of our debt and equity investments may in the future be, and certain investments have been in the\npast, negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, performance and financial results of the underlying\nentities, foreign exchange rates, changes in interest rates, the effect of new or changing regulations, the stock market\nin general, or other factors.\nWe measure certain of our non-marketable equity and debt securities, certain other instruments including stock-\nbased compensation awards settled in the stock of Other Bet companies, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in\na business combination, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, which is inherently subjective and requires management\njudgment and estimation. All gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities are recognized in OI&E, which\nincreases the volatility of our OI&E. The unrealized gains and losses or impairments we record from fair value\nremeasurements in any particular period may differ significantly from the gains and losses we ultimately realize on\nsuch investments.\nAs a result of these factors, the value of our investments could decline, which could harm our financial condition\nand operating results.\nRisks Related to our Industry\nPeople access our products and services through a variety of platforms and devices that continue to\nevolve with the advancement of technology and user preferences.

While we invest\nsignificantly in efforts to promote high-quality and relevant results and to detect and prevent low-quality content and\ninvalid traffic, we have been unable and may continue to be unable to detect and prevent all such abuses or promote\nuniformly high-quality content. Increased use of AI in our offerings and internal systems may create new avenues of\nabuse for bad actors.\nMany websites violate or attempt to violate our guidelines, including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in\nsearch results than our search engine's assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them. Such efforts have\naffected, and may continue to affect, the quality of content on our platforms and lead them to display false, misleading,\nor undesirable content. Although English-language web spam in our search results has been reduced, and web spam\nin most other languages is limited, we expect web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improve their\nrankings. Although we continue to invest in and deploy proprietary technology to detect and prevent web spam on our\nplatforms, there is no guarantee that our technology will always be successful, and our users may have negative\nexperiences on our platforms if our technology fails to work as intended, which may affect our users' decisions in\ncontinuing to use our platforms. We also face other challenges from low-quality and irrelevant content websites,\nincluding content farms, which are websites that generate large quantities of low-quality content to help them improve\ntheir search rankings. We are continually launching algorithmic changes designed to detect and prevent abuse from\nlow-quality websites, but we may not always be successful. We also face other challenges on our platforms, including\nviolations of our content guidelines involving incidents such as attempted election interference; activities that threaten\nthe safety and/or well-being of our users, including minors, on- or off-line; and the spreading of misinformation or\ndisinformation.\nIf we fail to either detect and prevent an increase in problematic content or effectively promote high-quality\ncontent, it could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information or reduce use of our platforms, harming our\nfinancial condition and operating results. It may also subject us to litigation and regulatory actions, which could result in\nmonetary penalties and damages and divert management\u2019s time and attention.\nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users. Internet\naccess providers may be able to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and\nservices, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers.\nOur products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet, and certain of our products\nrequire significant network capacity to work effectively. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have\nsignificant market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone\ncompanies, cable companies, mobile communications companies, and government-owned service providers. Some of\nthese providers have taken, or have stated that they may take, measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the\ncost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or\nfacilitate our offerings, by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings, or by providing our\ncompetitors preferential access. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination\nby internet access providers; however, substantial uncertainty exists in the U.S. and elsewhere regarding such\nprotections. In addition, in some jurisdictions, our products and services have been subject to government-initiated\nrestrictions or blockages. These could harm existing key relationships, including with our users, customers,\nadvertisers, and/or content providers, and impair our ability to attract new ones; harm our reputation; and increase\ncosts, thereby negatively affecting our business.\nRisks Related to Laws, Regulations, and Policies\nWe are subject to a variety of new, existing, and changing laws and regulations worldwide that could\nharm our business, and will likely be subject to an even broader scope of laws and regulations as we continue\nto expand our business.\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state as well as foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety\nof subjects, and our introduction of new businesses, products, services, and technologies will likely continue to subject\nus to additional laws and regulations. In recent years, governments around the world have proposed and adopted a\nlarge number of new laws and regulations relevant to the digital economy, particularly in the areas of data privacy and\nsecurity, competition, AI, and online content. The costs of compliance with these measures are high and are likely to\nincrease in the future, including as a result of differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws and regulations.\n18."

For example, the\nEU AI Act came into force on August 1, 2024, and will generally become fully applicable after a two-year\ntransitional period (although certain obligations will take effect at an earlier or later time). The EU AI Act\nintroduces various requirements for AI systems and models placed on the market or put into service in the EU,\nincluding specific transparency and other requirements for general purpose AI systems and the models on\nwhich those systems are based. In the U.S., there is increasing uncertainty as to the federal government's\napproach to AI regulation going forward, as the continued applicability of the White House's 2023 Executive\nOrder on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence, which lays out a\nframework for the U.S. government, among other things, to monitor private sector development of certain\nfoundation models, remains subject to regulatory development. Several states are considering enacting or\nhave already enacted regulations concerning the use of AI technologies, including those focused on consumer\nprotection, and depending on the scope of AI regulation at the federal level, some states may move to regulate\nAI model development and deployment. Further, at the federal and state level, there have been various\nproposals (and in some cases laws enacted) addressing \u201cdeepfakes\u201d and other AI-generated synthetic media.\n\u2022 Data privacy, collection, processing, and portability: Laws and regulations further restricting the collection,\nprocessing, and/or sharing of user or advertising-related data, including privacy and data protection laws; laws\naffecting the processing of children's data (as discussed further below), data breach notification laws; laws\nlimiting data transfers (including data localization laws); and laws requiring data portability (including the EU\nData Act, as discussed further below).\n\u2022 Copyright and other intellectual property: Copyright and related laws, including the EU Directive on\nCopyright in the Digital Single Market and European Economic Area transpositions, which have introduced\nnew licensing regimes, increase liability with respect to content uploaded by users or linked to from our\nplatforms, or create property rights in news publications that could require payments to news agencies and\npublishers, which may result in other regulatory actions.\n\u2022 Content moderation: Various laws covering content moderation and removal, and related disclosure\nobligations, such as the EU's Digital Services Act, Florida\u2019s Senate Bill 7072 and Texas\u2019 House Bill 20, and\nlaws and proposed legislation in Singapore, Australia, and the United Kingdom that impose penalties for failure\nto remove certain types of content or require disclosure of information about the operation of our services and\nalgorithms, which may make it harder for services like Google Search and YouTube to detect and deal with\nlow-quality, deceptive, or harmful content, or on the other hand, may impinge on the rights of free expression,\nwhich, in turn, could impact how our platforms are viewed by users. Additionally, legislators are increasingly\nfocused on regulating online child safety, including content protections for minors under eighteen years of age.\nThese regulations could result in our having to modify our products and services and incur additional costs to\noperate and monitor minors\u2019 experiences on our products and services.\n\u2022 Consumer protection: Consumer protection laws, including the EU\u2019s New Deal for Consumers, which could\nresult in monetary penalties and create a range of new compliance obligations.\nIn addition, the applicability and scope of these and other laws and regulations, as interpreted by courts,\nregulators, or administrative bodies, remain uncertain and could be interpreted in ways that harm our business. For\nexample, we rely on statutory safe harbors, like those set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Section 230\nof the Communications Decency Act in the U.S. and the Digital Services Act in Europe, to protect against liability for\nvarious linking, caching, ranking, recommending, and hosting activities. Legislation or court rulings affecting these safe\nharbors may harm us and may impose significant operational challenges. There are legislative proposals and pending\nlitigation in the U.S., EU, and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for websites and\nonline platforms.

In response, we have implemented robust programs, adopted reporting frameworks and\nprinciples, and announced a number of complex and ambitious goals and initiatives that may require considerable\ninvestments. We cannot guarantee that our goals and initiatives will be fully realized on the timelines we expect or at\nall, and projects that are completed as planned may not achieve the results we anticipate.\nWe are and may continue to be subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and\ninvestigations, enforcement actions, consent orders, and other forms of regulatory scrutiny and legal liability,\nincluding competition matters, that could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating\nresults.\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and investigations, other proceedings,\nand orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and\nemployment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or\npublishers using our platforms, personal injury, and other matters.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), various U.S. states, and other plaintiffs have filed, and may continue to file\nin the future, several antitrust lawsuits about various aspects of our business, including our advertising technologies\nand practices, the operation and distribution of Google Search, and the operation and distribution of the Android\noperating system and Play Store.\nFor example, the DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit alleging that Google violated\nantitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising, and in August 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of\nColumbia ruled that Google violated such antitrust laws. The Court is holding a separate proceeding to determine\nremedies, which could include alterations to our products and services and our business models and operations,\nincluding structural remedies, and/or our distribution arrangements, among other changes. While we plan to appeal,\nthere can be no assurance that our appeal will succeed, or that we will be able to change or decrease the severity of\nany remedies that may be ordered, and any or all of these potential remedies could harm our business, reputation,\nfinancial condition, and operating results.\nAlso, in December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict in Epic Games v. Google finding that Google violated\nantitrust laws relating to Google Play's business. The presiding judge issued a remedies decision in October 2024 that\nordered a variety of alterations to our business models and operations and contractual agreements for Android and\nGoogle Play. We are appealing the verdict, but if we are unsuccessful, we could face significant expenses to\nimplement the remedies, and such costs and alterations could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and\noperating results.\nFurthermore, in December 2020, several State Attorneys General, led by the Texas Attorney General, filed an\nantitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that Google violated antitrust and\nother laws relating to its advertising technology. This case is set for trial in March 2025, and we could face significant\ncivil penalties. In January 2023, the DOJ and several Attorneys General sued in the Eastern District of Virginia alleging\nsimilar antitrust violations relating to Google\u2019s advertising technology. Trial in the DOJ matter concluded in September\n2024 with a decision expected in early 2025. If we are unsuccessful, we could face an order on remedies that could\nharm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition to these regulatory proceedings, private individual and collective actions that overlap with claims\npursued by regulators are pending in the U.S. and in several other jurisdictions. Adverse results in these or similar\nfuture lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages and remedies that could harm our business, reputation,\nfinancial condition, and operating results.\nOther regulatory agencies in the U.S. and around the world, including competition enforcers, consumer protection\nagencies, and data protection authorities, have challenged and may continue to challenge our business practices and\ncompliance with laws and regulations. We are cooperating with these investigations and defending litigation or\nappealing decisions where appropriate.\nWe are also subject to a variety of claims including product warranty, product liability, and consumer protection\nclaims related to product defects, among other litigation, and we may also be subject to claims involving health and\nsafety, hazardous materials usage, other environmental effects, AI training, development, and commercialization, or\nservice disruptions or failures. Claims have been brought, and we expect will continue to be brought, against us for\n20."

The validity of various data transfer mechanisms we\ncurrently rely upon remains subject to legal, regulatory, and political developments globally, which may require us to\nadapt our existing arrangements.\nWe face, and may continue to face, intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, violation of\nrights of publicity, and other claims that could be costly to defend, result in significant damage awards or\nother costs (including indemnification awards), and limit our ability to use certain technologies.\nWe, like other internet, technology, and media companies, are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations\nof infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights, including patent, copyright, trade secrets, and\ntrademarks. Parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in U.S. and international courts\nand the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) for exclusion and cease-and-desist orders. In addition, patent-\nholding companies may frequently seek to generate income from patents they have obtained by bringing claims\nagainst us. As we continue to expand our business, the number of intellectual property claims against us has increased\nand may continue to increase as we develop and acquire new products, services, and technologies, including AI\ntechnologies.\nAdverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing\nagreements (if licenses are available at all), or orders limiting our ability to sell our products and services in the U.S. or\nelsewhere, including by preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services in certain\njurisdictions. They may also cause us to change our business practices in ways that could result in a loss of revenues\nfor us and otherwise harm our business.\nMany of our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require us to defend\nagainst certain intellectual property infringement claims and in some cases indemnify them for certain intellectual\nproperty infringement claims against them, which could result in increased costs for defending such claims or\nsignificant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Such customers and partners may also\ndiscontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could\nresult in loss of revenues and harm our business. Moreover, intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our\nsuppliers, when obtainable, may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers arising from\nintellectual property infringement claims. Furthermore, in connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in\nthe future agree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, including those associated with intellectual\nproperty claims. Regardless of their merits, intellectual property claims are often time consuming and expensive to\nlitigate or settle. To the extent such claims are successful, they could harm our business, including our product and\nservice offerings, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or\nexposure to additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions.\nOur effective tax rates are affected by a variety of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with\ndifferent statutory tax rates, net gains and losses on hedges and related transactions under our foreign exchange risk\nmanagement program, changes in our stock price for shares issued as employee compensation, changes in the\nvaluation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, and the application of different provisions of tax laws or changes in tax\nlaws, regulations, or accounting principles (including changes in the interpretation of existing laws). Further, if we are\nunable or fail to collect taxes on behalf of customers, employees and partners as the withholding agent, we could\nbecome liable for taxes that are levied against third parties.\nWe are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. As a result, we have\nreceived, and may in the future receive, assessments in multiple jurisdictions, on various tax-related assertions, such\nas transfer-pricing adjustments or permanent-establishment claims. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit\ncould harm our financial condition and operating results, require adverse changes to our business practices, or subject\nus to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income\ntaxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and often involves uncertainty. Although we believe our\nestimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements\nand may affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nFurthermore, due to shifting economic and political conditions, tax policies, laws, or rates in various jurisdictions\nmay be subject to significant changes in ways that could harm our financial condition and operating results.

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is\ncoordinating negotiations among more than 140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus around substantial\nchanges to international tax policies, including the implementation of a minimum global effective tax rate of 15%, on\nwhich various jurisdictions around the world have either introduced draft legislation or adopted final legislation. Our\neffective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase as a result of these changes.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Stock\nWe cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program or dividend program will be continuously active\nor fully consummated or will enhance long-term stockholder value, and share repurchases or dividends could\nincrease the volatility of our stock prices and could diminish our cash reserves.\nWe engage in share repurchases of our Class A and Class C stock from time to time in accordance with\nauthorizations from the Board of Directors of Alphabet. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and\ndoes not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. In\nApril 2024, we announced the approval of our cash dividend program and began paying regular cash dividends to our\nClass A, Class B, and Class C stockholders. Any and all future cash dividends are subject to declaration by our Board\nof Directors in its sole discretion, and in accordance with the requirements of any applicable laws, rules, and\nregulations, including the Delaware General Corporation Law. Our cash dividend program does not require, and our\nBoard of Directors may decide not to declare, a cash dividend each quarter, and does not obligate our Board of\nDirectors to declare a dividend at any specific dollar amount per share. Any such decision by our Board of Directors\nmay depend on a variety of factors that it may deem relevant, including but not limited to our earnings, liquidity,\nfinancial condition, other capital deployment opportunities, level of indebtedness, and general market conditions. Our\nshare repurchases or dividends could affect our share trading prices, increase their volatility, reduce our cash reserves\nand may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock.\nThe concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B stock has 10 votes per share, our Class A stock has one vote per share, and our Class C stock has\nno voting rights. As of December 31, 2024, Larry Page and Sergey Brin beneficially owned approximately 87.4% of our\noutstanding Class B stock, which represented approximately 52.1% of the voting power of our outstanding common\nstock. Through their stock ownership, Larry and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring\nstockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or\nother sale of our company or our assets, for the foreseeable future. In addition, because our Class C stock carries no\nvoting rights (except as required by applicable law), the issuance of the Class C stock, including in future stock-based\nacquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs, could continue Larry and Sergey\u2019s current\nrelative voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters\nsubmitted to a vote of our stockholders. The share repurchases made pursuant to our repurchase program may also\naffect Larry and Sergey\u2019s relative voting power. This concentrated control limits or severely restricts other stockholders\u2019\nability to influence corporate matters and we may take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial,\nwhich could reduce the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C stock.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that\nstockholders may consider favorable.\nProvisions in Alphabet\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a\nchange of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022 Our Board of Directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of\nDirectors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director.\n\u2022 Our stockholders may not act by written consent, which makes it difficult to take certain actions without holding\na stockholders' meeting.\n\u2022 Our certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of\nminority stockholders to elect director candidates.\n\u2022 Stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the Board of Directors or to\npropose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter\na potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer's own slate of directors or\notherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.\n23."

Some of the areas where we face risks include:\n\u2022 diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and\nother strategic arrangements;\n\u2022 failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities; conditions placed\nupon approval that could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or otherwise\nrestrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of a transaction; or investigations or\nlitigation by governmental authorities related to our acquisitions and other strategic arrangements;\n\u2022 failure to successfully integrate the acquired operations, technologies, services, and personnel (including\ncultural integration and retention of employees) and further develop the acquired business or technology;\n\u2022 implementation of controls (or remediation of control deficiencies), procedures, and policies at the acquired\ncompany;\n\u2022 integration of the acquired company\u2019s accounting and other administrative systems, and the coordination of\nproduct, engineering, and sales and marketing functions;\n\u2022 transition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms;\n\u2022 in the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages\nand to address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific\ncountries;\n\u2022 failure to accomplish commercial, strategic or financial objectives with respect to investments, joint ventures,\nand other strategic arrangements;\n\u2022 failure to realize the value of investments and joint ventures due to a lack of liquidity;\n\u2022 liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark\ninfringement claims, data privacy and security issues, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities,\nwarranty claims, product liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities; and\n24."

In addition, our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be\nsuccessful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Immigration policy and\nregulatory changes may also affect our ability to hire, mobilize, or retain some of our global talent. All of our executive\nofficers and key employees are at-will employees, and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies.\nIn addition, we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. As our organization\ngrows and evolves, we may need to adapt our corporate culture and work environments to ever-changing\ncircumstances, such as during times of a natural disaster or pandemic, and these changes could affect our ability to\ncompete effectively or have an adverse effect on our corporate culture.

UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNot applicable.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nWe maintain a comprehensive process for identifying, assessing, and managing material risks from cybersecurity\nthreats as part of our broader risk management system and processes. For example, some risks include our software\nsupply chain and other third-party dependencies, vulnerabilities in our products and services, theft of our intellectual\nproperty, and attempts to compromise our infrastructure. We obtain input, as appropriate, for our cybersecurity risk\nmanagement program on the security industry and threat trends from multiple external experts and internal threat\nintelligence teams. Teams of dedicated privacy, safety, and security professionals oversee cybersecurity risk\nmanagement and mitigation, incident prevention, detection, and remediation. These teams comprise professionals with\ndeep cybersecurity expertise across multiple industries and are led by our Vice President of Privacy, Safety, and\nSecurity Engineering, who has 20 years of experience, including roles in technology infrastructure for two other large\npublic companies. Our executive leadership team, along with input from the above teams, are responsible for our\noverall enterprise risk management system and processes and regularly consider cybersecurity risks in the context of\nother material risks to the company.\nAs part of our cybersecurity risk management system, our incident management teams track and log privacy and\nsecurity incidents across Alphabet, our vendors, and other third-party service providers to remediate and resolve any\nsuch incidents. Significant incidents are reviewed regularly by a cross-functional working group to determine whether\nfurther escalation is appropriate. Any incident assessed as potentially being or potentially becoming material is\npromptly escalated for further assessment, and then reported to designated members of our senior management. We\nconsult with outside counsel as appropriate, including on materiality analysis and disclosure matters, and our senior\n25."

Discussion of 2023 results\ncompared to 2022 results to the extent not included in this report can be found in Item 7 of our 2023 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K.\nUnderstanding Alphabet\u2019s Financial Results\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses \u2014 the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments,\nGoogle Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For further\ndetails on our segments, see Part I, Item 1 Business and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTrends in Our Business and Financial Effect\nThe following long-term trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate\nthat they will continue to affect our future results:\n\u2022 Users' behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves.\nThe continuing evolution of the online world has contributed to the growth of our business and our revenues since\ninception. We expect that this evolution will continue to benefit our business and our revenues, although at a slower\npace than we have experienced historically. In addition, we face increasing competition for user engagement and\nadvertisers, including from other developers and providers of AI products and services, which may affect our revenues.\n\u2022 Users continue to access our products and services using diverse devices and modalities, which\nallows for new advertising formats that may benefit our revenues but adversely affect our margins.\nOur users are accessing our products and services via diverse devices and modalities beyond traditional desktop,\nsuch as smartphones, wearables, connected TVs, and smart home devices, and want to be able to be connected no\nmatter where they are or what they are doing. We are focused on expanding our products and services to stay in front\nof these trends in order to maintain and grow our business.\nWe benefit from advertising revenues generated from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising\nformats. The margins from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional\ndesktop search. Additionally, as the market for a particular device type or modality matures, our advertising revenues\nmay be affected. For example, changing dynamics within the global smartphone market, such as increased market\nsaturation in developed countries, can affect our mobile advertising revenues.\nWe expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our revenues grow\nand TAC as a percentage of our advertising revenues (\"TAC rate\") to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic\nmix; partner agreement terms; partner mix; the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points; product\nmix; the relative revenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels; and revenue share terms.\nWe expect these trends to continue to affect our revenues and put pressure on our margins.\n\u2022 As online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings, which may affect our\nmonetization.\nAs interactions between users and advertisers change, and as online user behavior evolves, for example with AI,\nwe continue to expand our product offerings to serve these changing needs, which may affect monetization of our\nproducts and services. We expect to continue to incorporate AI innovations into our products, such as AI in Search,\nthat could affect our monetization trends. When developing new products and services we generally focus first on user\nexperience and then on monetization.\n\u2022 As users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets\ncontinue to increase, and may require continued investments. In addition, movements in foreign exchange\nrates affect such revenues.\nThe shift to online, as well as the advent of the multi-device world, has brought opportunities outside of the U.S.,\nincluding in emerging markets, such as India. We continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our\nproducts and advertising programs relevant to our users in these markets. This has led to a trend of increased\n30."

We expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these\nmarkets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available. This trend could affect our revenues as\ndeveloping markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets.\nInternational revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a foreign exchange risk management program\ndesigned to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues\nand earnings.\n\u2022 The revenues that we derive beyond advertising are increasing and may adversely affect our margins.\nRevenues from cloud, consumer subscriptions, platforms, and devices, which may have differing characteristics\nthan our advertising revenues, have grown over time, and we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding\nour products and services. The margins on these revenues vary significantly and are generally lower than the margins\non our advertising revenues. For example, sales of our devices adversely affect our consolidated margins due to\npressures on pricing and higher cost of sales.\n\u2022 As we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and\ncapital expenditures.\nWe continue to make significant research and development investments in areas of strategic focus as we seek to\ndevelop new, innovative offerings, improve our existing offerings, and rapidly and responsibly deploy AI across our\nbusinesses. We also expect to increase, relative to 2024, our investment in our technical infrastructure, including\nservers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term initiatives, in\nparticular in support of AI products and services. In addition, acquisitions and strategic investments remain important\nelements in our use of capital and contribute to the breadth and depth of our offerings, expand our expertise in\nengineering and other functional areas, and build strong partnerships around strategic initiatives.\n\u2022 We continue to face an evolving regulatory environment, and we are subject to claims, lawsuits,\ninvestigations, and other forms of potential legal liability, which could affect our business practices and\nfinancial results.\nChanges in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide\nrange of topics and related legal matters, including investigations, lawsuits, and regulatory actions, have resulted in\nfines and caused us to change our business practices. As these global trends continue, our cost of doing business may\nincrease, our products and services may become less useful, our ability to pursue certain business practices or offer\ncertain products or services may be limited, and we may need to change our business models and operations to\ncomply with evolving regulatory and legal matters.

We expect to continue\nhiring talented employees around the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs. For additional\ninformation, see Culture and Workforce in Part I, Item 1 Business of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenues and Monetization Metrics\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide\nenterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure, platform services, and applications; sales of other products and\nservices, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and devices. For\nadditional information on how we recognize revenue, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition to the long-term trends and their financial effect on our business discussed above, fluctuations in our\nrevenues have been and may continue to be affected by a combination of factors, including:\n\u2022 changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022 changes in pricing, such as those resulting from changes in fee structures, discounts, and customer incentives;\n\u2022 general economic conditions and various external dynamics, including geopolitical events, regulations, and\nother measures and their effect on advertiser, consumer, and enterprise spending;\n\u2022 new product, service, and market launches; and\n31."

Additionally,\nfluctuations in employee compensation expenses may not directly correlate with changes in headcount, due to factors\nsuch as annual stock-based compensation (SBC) awards that generally vest over four years.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues.\n\u2022 TAC includes:\n\u25e6 amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services.\nOur distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers,\nand software developers; and\n\u25e6 amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n\u2022 Other cost of revenues primarily includes:\n\u25e6 content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and\nother content for distribution, primarily related to YouTube (we pay fees to these content providers\nbased on revenues generated, subscriber counts, or a flat fee);\n\u25e6 depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure;\n\u25e6 employee compensation expenses related to our technical infrastructure and other operations such as\ncontent review and customer and product support;\n\u25e6 inventory and other costs related to the devices we sell; and\n\u25e6 other technical infrastructure operations costs, including network capacity, energy, and equipment\ncosts.\nTAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly\nhigher than TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search & other properties,\nbecause most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our\nGoogle Network partners.\nOperating Expenses\n33."

We believe the\npresentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles\n(GAAP) results helps improve the ability to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign\ncurrency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant\nperiod over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency\nexchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level.\nWe use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year\nbasis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable\nperiod exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.\nConstant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period\nrevenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated\nusing prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods.\nThese results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with\nGAAP.

Depreciation of our property and equipment commences\nwhen the deployment of such assets are completed and are ready for our intended use. For the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2024, our depreciation on property and equipment was $11.9 billion and $15.3 billion,\nrespectively.\nLeases\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024, we recognized additional operating lease assets of $2.9\nbillion and $2.5 billion, and additional finance lease assets of $564 million and $313 million, respectively. As of\nDecember 31, 2024, the amount of total future lease payments under operating leases, which had a weighted average\nremaining lease term of 7.8 years, was $17.0 billion, of which $3.2 billion is short-term, and total future lease payments\nunder finance leases, which had a weighted average remaining lease term of 10.4 years, was $1.9 billion, of which\n$257 million is short-term. As of December 31, 2024, we have entered into leases that have not yet commenced with\nfuture short-term and long-term lease payments of $773 million and $6.5 billion, respectively, that are not yet recorded\non our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These leases will commence between 2025 and 2028 with non-cancelable lease\nterms of one to 25 years.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024, our operating lease expenses (including variable lease costs)\nwere $4.5 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively. Finance lease costs were $504 million and $444 million for the years\nended December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. For additional information, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFinancing\nWe have a short-term debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net\nproceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2024, we had $2.3 billion of\nshort-term commercial paper outstanding.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with a total carrying value of $11.9 billion\nwith short-term and long-term future interest payments of $197 million and $3.4 billion, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, $4.0 billion expiring in April 2025 and\n$6.0 billion expiring in April 2028. The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using\ncertain market rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals. No amounts have\nbeen borrowed under the credit facilities.

For more information related to our content licenses, see Note\n10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition, we regularly enter into multi-year, non-cancellable agreements to purchase renewable energy and\nenergy attributes, such as renewable energy certificates. These agreements do not include a minimum dollar\ncommitment. The amounts to be paid under these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated and\nare not readily determinable.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In doing so, we have to make\nestimates and assumptions. Our critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of\nuncertainty at the time the estimate was made, and changes in them have had or are reasonably likely to have a\nmaterial effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from\nour estimates. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable\nunder the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We have reviewed our critical\naccounting estimates with the Audit and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors.\nFor a summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements, see Note 1 of the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFair Value Measurements of Non-Marketable Equity Securities\nWe measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, consisting primarily of our non-\nmarketable equity securities. These investments are accounted for under the measurement alternative method (\"the\nmeasurement alternative\") and are measured at cost, less impairment, subject to upward and downward adjustments\nresulting from observable price changes for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. These adjustments\nrequire quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities, which may require the use of unobservable inputs.\nAdjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date and involve the use of\nestimates using the best information available, which may include cash flow projections or other available market data.\nNon-marketable equity securities are also evaluated for impairment, based on qualitative factors including the\ncompanies' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among others. When indicators of\nimpairment exist, we prepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market\napproach or an income approach, which requires judgment and the use of unobservable inputs, including discount\nrates, investee revenues and costs, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others.\nWhen the quantitative remeasurements of fair value indicate an impairment exists, we write down the investment to its\ncurrent fair value.\nWe also have compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain investments, i.e.\nperformance fees. We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may\nresult in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use\nof unobservable inputs.\nProperty and Equipment\nWe assess the reasonableness of the useful lives of our property and equipment periodically as well as when\nother changes occur, such as when there are changes to ongoing business operations, changes in the planned use\nand utilization of assets, or technological advancements, that could indicate a change in the period over which we\nexpect to benefit from the asset.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating\nour uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.\nRecording an uncertain tax position involves various qualitative considerations, including evaluation of\ncomparable and resolved tax exposures, applicability of tax laws, and likelihood of settlement. We evaluate uncertain\ntax positions periodically, considering changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial\nopinions, as well as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities. Although we believe we have adequately\nreserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not\nbe different.

In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns\nby the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of\nadverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for\nincome taxes.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and investigations, other proceedings,\nand consent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance,\nlabor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by\nadvertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. Certain of these\nmatters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we\nbelieve that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine\nthat a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in Note\n10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that\nhas been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make\nadjustments and changes to our disclosures. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood and the\nestimated amount of a loss related to such matters. Until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an\nexposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates,\nand equity investment risks.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. International revenues, as well as costs and expenses\ndenominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the\nU.S. dollar. As discussed below, we enter into derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency risk. Principal\ncurrencies hedged included the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro, and Japanese yen. For the\npurpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk, we considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange\nrates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% could be\nexperienced.\nWe use foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on monetary assets and\nliabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. These forward and option\ncontracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets\nand liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on these assets and liabilities are recorded in OI&E, which are\noffset by the gains and losses on the forward and option contracts.\nIf an adverse 10% foreign currency exchange rate change was applied to net monetary assets, liabilities, and\ncommitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies at the balance sheet date, it would have\nresulted in an adverse effect on income before income taxes of approximately $503 million and $135 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively, after consideration of the effect of foreign exchange contracts in place for\nthe years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024.\nWe use foreign currency forward and option contracts, including collars (an option strategy comprised of a\ncombination of purchased and written options) to protect forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from changes in\nforeign currency exchange rates. When the U.S. dollar strengthens, gains from foreign currency forward and option\ncontacts reduce the foreign currency losses related to our earnings. When the U.S. dollar weakens, losses from foreign\ncurrency forward and option contracts offset the foreign currency gains related to our earnings. These hedging\ncontracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We designate\nthese contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. We reflect the gains and losses of foreign currency spot\nrate changes as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and subsequently reclassify them\ninto revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur.\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10% as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, the amount recorded in AOCI related to\nour cash flow hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion lower as of\n45."

The change in the value recorded in AOCI would be expected to offset a\ncorresponding foreign currency change in forecasted hedged revenues when recognized.\nWe use foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency\nrisks related to investment in foreign subsidiaries. These forward contracts serve to offset the foreign currency\ntranslation risk from our foreign operations.\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10%, the amount recorded in cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) within AOCI\nrelated to our net investment hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $946 million and $660 million\nlower as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. The change in value recorded in CTA would be expected to\noffset a corresponding foreign currency translation gain or loss from our investment in foreign subsidiaries.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur Corporate Treasury investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and\nmaintain liquidity. We invest primarily in debt securities, including government bonds, corporate debt securities,\nmortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, money market and other funds, time deposits, and interest rate\nderivatives. By policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and\nfloating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair\nmarket value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income\nthan predicted if interest rates fall. Unrealized gains and losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to\ninterest rate fluctuations as compared to interest rates at the time of purchase. For certain fixed and variable rate debt\nsecurities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in OI&E. We measure\nsecurities for which we have not elected the fair value option at fair value with gains and losses recorded in AOCI until\nthe securities are sold, less any expected credit losses.\nWe use value-at-risk (VaR) analysis to determine the potential effect of fluctuations in interest rates on the value\nof our investment portfolio. The VaR is the expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, for our\ninvestment portfolio due to adverse movements in interest rates. We use a variance/covariance VaR model with 95%\nconfidence interval. The estimated one-day loss in fair value of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2023 and\n2024 are shown below (in millions):\n12-Month Average\nAs of December 31, As of December 31,\n2023 2024 2023 2024\nRisk category - interest rate $ 296 $ 208 $ 271 $ 230\nActual future gains and losses associated with our investment portfolio may differ materially from the sensitivity\nanalyses performed as of December 31, 2023 and 2024 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the\ntiming and amount of changes in interest rates and our actual exposures and positions. VaR analysis is not intended to\nrepresent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation.\nEquity Investment Risk\nOur marketable and non-marketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that\ncould substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings.\nOur marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds and our non-marketable equity securities are\ninvestments in privately held companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages.\nWe record marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily\ndeterminable market values, of which publicly traded stocks and mutual funds are subject to market price volatility, and\nrepresent $6.0 billion and $5.1 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. A\nhypothetical adverse price change of 10% on our December 31, 2024 balance would decrease the fair value of\nmarketable equity securities by $508 million. From time to time, we may enter into derivatives to hedge the market\nprice risk on certain of our marketable equity securities.\nOur non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are primarily adjusted to fair\nvalue for observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as\nthe measurement alternative). The fair value measured at the time of the observable transaction is not necessarily an\nindication of the current fair value as of the balance sheet date. These investments, especially those that are in the\nearly stages, are inherently risky because the technologies or products these companies have under development are\ntypically in the early phases and may never materialize, and they may experience a decline in financial condition,\nwhich could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. Valuations of our equity\ninvestments in private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data and\n46."

In addition, global economic conditions\ncould result in additional volatility. The success of our investment in any private company is also typically dependent on\nthe likelihood of our ability to realize appreciation in the value of investments through liquidity events such as public\nofferings, acquisitions, private sales or other market events. Changes in the valuation of non-marketable equity\nsecurities may not directly correlate with changes in valuation of marketable equity securities. As of December 31,\n2023 and 2024, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities, which were accounted for under the\nmeasurement alternative, was $28.8 billion and $35.5 billion, respectively.\nThe carrying values of our equity method investments, which totaled approximately $1.7 billion and $2.0 billion as\nof December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively, generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes.

We\nbelieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding\nthe reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies\nand procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are\nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations\nof management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on\nthe financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 4, 2025\n51."

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August\n2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became\nthe successor issuer to Google.\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide\nenterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure, platform services, and applications; sales of other products and\nservices, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and devices.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated\nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes.\nActual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our\nestimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; contingent liabilities; fair values of financial\ninstruments and goodwill; income taxes; inventory; and useful lives of property and equipment, among others. We\nbase our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable, and the\nresults of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, and\nthe collectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or services is probable. Sales and other\nsimilar taxes are excluded from revenues.\nAdvertising Revenues\nWe generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on:\n\u2022 Google Search and other properties, including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners\nwho use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated\nproperties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n\u2022 YouTube properties; and\n\u2022 Google Network properties, including revenues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob,\nAdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\nOur customers generally purchase advertising inventory through Google Ads, Google Ad Manager, Google\nDisplay & Video 360, and Google Marketing Platform, among others.\nWe offer advertising by delivering both performance and brand advertising. We recognize revenues for\nperformance advertising when a user engages with the advertisement. For brand advertising, we recognize revenues\nwhen the ad is displayed, or a user views the ad.\nFor ads placed on Google Network properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on\na gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed\non Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues,\nand amounts paid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of revenues. Where we are the principal, we\ncontrol the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to\nmonetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being\nprimarily responsible to our customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing.\nGoogle Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues consist of revenues from:\n57."

We report\nrevenues from Google Play sales of apps and in-app purchases on a net basis because our performance obligation is\nto facilitate a transaction between app developers and end users for which we earn a service fee.\nGoogle Cloud Revenues\nGoogle Cloud revenues consist of revenues from:\n\u2022 Google Cloud Platform, which generates consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure,\nplatform, and other services. These services provide access to solutions such as AI offerings including our AI\ninfrastructure, Vertex AI platform, and Gemini for Google Cloud; cybersecurity; and data and analytics;\n\u2022 Google Workspace, which includes subscriptions for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for\nenterprises, such as Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Drive, and Meet, with integrated features like Gemini for Google\nWorkspace; and\n\u2022 other enterprise services.\nOur cloud services are generally provided on either a consumption or subscription basis and may have contract\nterms longer than a year. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis are recognized when\nthe customer utilizes the services, based on the quantity of services consumed. Revenues related to cloud services\nprovided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer receives and\nconsumes the benefits of the cloud services.\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate\nrevenues to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine\nstandalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers.\nCustomer Incentives and Credits\nCertain customers receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration.\nWe estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues. We\nbelieve that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration related to customer\nincentives and credits.\nSales Commissions\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred when the period of the expected benefit is one year or less. We\nrecognize an asset for certain sales commissions and amortize if the expected benefit period is greater than one year.\nThese costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues consists of TAC and other costs of revenues.\n\u2022 TAC includes:\n\u25e6 amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services.\nOur distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers,\nand software developers; and\n\u25e6 amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n\u2022 Other cost of revenues includes:\n\u25e6 content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and\nother content for distribution, primarily related to YouTube (we pay fees to these content providers\nbased on revenues generated, subscriber counts, or a flat fee);\n\u25e6 depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure;\n58."

As a result, development costs\nthat meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented.\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and\ncloud-based applications used to deliver our services. We capitalize development costs related to these software\napplications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the\nsoftware will be used to perform the function intended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications\nwere not material for the periods presented.\nStock-based Compensation\nStock-based compensation (SBC) primarily consists of Alphabet restricted stock units (RSUs). RSUs are equity\nclassified and measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. We recognize RSU expense\nusing the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur.\nRSUs are awarded dividend equivalents, which are subject to the same vesting conditions as the underlying award,\nand settled in Class C shares.\nFor RSUs, shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory income tax withholding to be\npaid by us on behalf of our employees. As a result, fewer shares are issued than the number of RSUs outstanding, and\nthe income tax withholding is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.\nAdditionally, SBC includes other stock-based awards, such as performance stock units (PSUs) that include\nmarket conditions and awards that may be settled in cash or the stock of certain Other Bet companies. PSUs and\ncertain awards granted by Other Bet companies are equity classified and expense is recognized over the requisite\nservice period. Certain awards granted by Other Bet companies are liability classified and remeasured at fair value\nthrough settlement. The fair value of awards granted by Other Bet companies is based on the equity valuation of the\nrespective Other Bet company.\nAdvertising and Promotional Expenses\nWe expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred. For the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $9.2 billion, $8.7\nbillion, and $8.7 billion, respectively.\nPerformance Fees\nPerformance fees refer to compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain\ninvestments. We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may\nresult in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use\nof unobservable inputs. Performance fees are recorded as a component of OI&E.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured\nand classified in accordance with a three-tier fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the inputs available in\nthe market used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active\nmarkets.\nLevel 2 - Inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for\nidentical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all\nsignificant inputs are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data. Where applicable,\n59."

The determination of fair value involves the use of appropriate\nvaluation methods and relevant inputs into valuation models.\nOur financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents,\nmarketable securities, derivative financial instruments, and certain non-marketable debt securities. Our financial assets\nmeasured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include non-marketable equity securities. Other financial assets and\nliabilities are carried at cost with fair value disclosed, if required.\nWe measure certain other instruments, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, also\nat fair value on a nonrecurring basis.\nFinancial Instruments\nOur financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents, marketable and non-marketable securities, derivative\nfinancial instruments, accounts receivable, and convertible notes.\nCredit Risks\nWe are subject to credit risk primarily from cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, derivative financial\ninstruments, including foreign exchange contracts, accounts receivable, and convertible notes. We manage our credit\nrisk exposure through timely assessment of our counterparty creditworthiness, credit limits, and use of collateral\nmanagement. Foreign exchange contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing.\nAccounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the\nworld. We manage our credit risk exposure by performing ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we\nlimit the amount of credit we extend. We generally do not require collateral from our customers.\nCash Equivalents\nWe invest excess cash primarily in asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, corporate debt securities,\ngovernment bonds, money market funds, and time deposits.\nMarketable Securities\nWe classify all marketable debt securities that have effective maturities of three months or less from the date of\npurchase as cash equivalents and those with effective maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities\non our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable\ndebt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. We have\nclassified and accounted for our marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. After consideration of our risk versus\nreward objectives, as well as our liquidity requirements, we may sell these debt securities prior to their effective\nmaturities. As we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify highly liquid securities\nwith maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets. We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a\ncomponent of stockholders\u2019 equity, except for the changes in allowance for expected credit losses, which are recorded\nin OI&E. For certain marketable debt securities we have elected the fair value option, for which changes in fair value\nare recorded in OI&E. We determine any realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable debt securities on a\nspecific identification method, and we record such gains and losses as a component of OI&E.\nOur investments in marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with the related gains and losses,\nincluding unrealized, recognized in OI&E. We classify our marketable equity securities subject to long-term lock-up\nrestrictions beyond 12 months as other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNon-Marketable Securities\nNon-marketable securities primarily consist of equity securities. We account for non-marketable equity securities\nthrough which we exercise significant influence but do not have control over the investee under the equity method.\nOther non-marketable equity securities that we hold are primarily accounted for under the measurement alternative.\nUnder the measurement alternative, the carrying value is measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus\nchanges resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the\nsame issuer.

The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or\nservices and customers, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer.\nAdditionally, accounts receivable includes amounts for services performed in advance of the right to invoice the\ncustomer.\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable, which is recorded as an offset to accounts\nreceivable, and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements\nof Income. We assess collectibility by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics\nexist and on an individual basis when we identify specific customers with known disputes or collectibility issues. In\ndetermining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we consider historical collectibility based on past due status\nand make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also consider\ncustomer-specific information, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic\nconditions.\nConvertible Notes\nOur investments in convertible notes are primarily recorded at amortized cost which includes unpaid principal\nbalances, deferred origination costs, and any related discount or premium, net of allowances for credit losses, and are\nincluded within other non-current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOther\nOur financial instruments also include debt and equity investments in companies with which we also entered into\ncommercial arrangements at or near the same time. For these transactions, judgment is required in assessing the\nsubstance of the arrangements, including assessing whether the components of the arrangements should be\naccounted for as separate transactions under the applicable GAAP, and determining the value of the components of\nthe arrangements, including the fair value of the investments. Additionally, if our investment in such companies\nbecomes impaired, we may need to re-evaluate the accounting for the commercial arrangement, including reducing\nany remaining performance obligations.\nImpairment of Investments\nWe periodically review our debt and non-marketable equity securities for impairment.\nFor debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists. The credit loss is\nestimated by considering available information relevant to the collectibility of the security and information about past\nevents, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Any credit loss is recorded as a charge to OI&E,\nnot to exceed the amount of the unrealized loss. Unrealized losses other than the credit loss are recognized in AOCI. If\nwe have an intent to sell, or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a debt security in an unrealized\nloss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis, we will write down the security to its fair value and record the\ncorresponding charge as a component of OI&E.\nFor non-marketable equity securities, including equity method investments, we consider whether impairment\nindicators exist by evaluating the companies' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among\nother indicators. If the assessment indicates that the investment is impaired, we write down the investment to its fair\nvalue by recording the corresponding charge as a component of OI&E. We prepare quantitative measurements of the\nfair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income approach.\nInventory\nInventory consists primarily of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is\ncomputed using the first-in, first-out method.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in\nwhich we have other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity (VIE). We consolidate VIEs when we are\n61."

We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have the power to direct activities that most\nsignificantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses\nor benefits. If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a\nVIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.\nPeriodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination\nof whether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is comprised of technical infrastructure, office space, corporate and other assets\ncurrently in service, and assets not yet in service. Technical infrastructure includes data center land, buildings and\nleasehold improvements, and servers and network equipment. Office space includes office land, buildings and\nleasehold improvements. Assets not yet in service are those that are not ready for our intended use, including data\ncenter buildings and servers in the process of construction or assembly.\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation commences once assets\nare ready for our intended use and is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the\nassets, which we regularly evaluate for factors such as technological obsolescence and our planned use and\nutilization. We depreciate data center and office buildings over periods of seven to 40 years. We depreciate servers\nand network equipment generally over a period of six years. We depreciate corporate and other assets over periods of\ntwo to 25 years. We depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated\nuseful lives of the assets. Land is not depreciated.\nGoodwill\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. We\nevaluate our reporting units periodically, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in\nreporting units, we reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. We test our goodwill for\nimpairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be\nimpaired. Goodwill impairments were not material for the periods presented.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-\nlease components. Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed. Non-lease components primarily\ninclude payments for maintenance and utilities. We combine fixed payments for non-lease components with lease\npayments and account for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets\nand liabilities.\nCertain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the\nlease assets and liabilities. These amounts primarily include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index, and\npayments for maintenance and utilities.\nLease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease\ncommencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our\nincremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable. Our incremental\nborrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments,\nand in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Our lease terms include periods under options to\nextend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally use the\nbase, non-cancelable, lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. Lease assets also include any\nprepaid lease payments and lease incentives.\nLease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The current portion of our\noperating lease liabilities is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and the long-term portion is\nincluded in operating lease liabilities. Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment, net. Finance lease\nliabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or other long-term liabilities.\nOperating lease expense (excluding variable lease costs) is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease\nterm. Finance lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life\nof the asset, and interest expense is recognized based on the incremental borrowing rate.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review leases, property and equipment, and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment when\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed\n62."

If the carrying value of the assets or asset group is not recoverable, the impairment recognized is\nmeasured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which we recognize the amount of taxes\npayable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of\nevents that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We measure current and deferred tax\nassets and liabilities based on provisions of enacted tax law. We evaluate the likelihood of future realization of our\ndeferred tax assets based on all available evidence and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets\nwhen it is more likely than not that they will not be realized or release a valuation allowance to increase deferred tax\nassets when it is more likely than not that they will be realized.

The tax benefits of the position recognized in the\nfinancial statements are then measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be\nrealized upon settlement with a taxing authority. In addition, we recognize interest and penalties related to\nunrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the acquisition date. We allocate the\npurchase price of the acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values,\nexcept for revenue contracts acquired, which are recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The\nexcess of the purchase price over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\nForeign Currency\nWe translate the financial statements of our international subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange\nrates for assets and liabilities, and average rates for the period derived from month-end exchange rates for revenues,\ncosts, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in AOCI as a component of stockholders\u2019 equity. We\nreflect net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction currency to\nfunctional currency as a component of foreign currency exchange gain (loss) in OI&E.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update\n(ASU) 2023-09 \"Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\" to expand the disclosure\nrequirements for income taxes. Upon adoption we will be required to disclose additional specified categories in the rate\nreconciliation in both percentage and dollar amounts. We will also be required to disclose the amount of income taxes\npaid disaggregated by jurisdiction, among other disclosure requirements. The standard can be applied either\nprospectively or retrospectively. We will adopt the standard in our 2025 annual period and are currently assessing the\neffect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03 \"Income Statement: Reporting Comprehensive Income-\nExpense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40)\" to improve the disclosures about an entity\u2019s expenses. Upon\nadoption, we will be required to disclose in the notes to the financial statements a disaggregation of certain expense\ncategories included within the expense captions on the face of the income statement. The standard is effective for our\n2027 annual period, and our interim periods beginning in 2028, with early adoption permitted. The standard can be\napplied either prospectively or retrospectively. We are currently assessing adoption timing and the effect that the\nupdated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07 \u201cSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to\nReportable Segment Disclosures\u201d which expands annual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments,\nprimarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses.

The primary risk\nmanaged is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings,\nand investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We\nalso enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance investment returns.\nWe recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the derivatives\nprimarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy comprised of a\ncombination of purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at gross fair values.\nThe accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation.\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge\ncertain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have\nmaturities of 24 months or less.\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and\nsubsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points and\ntime value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life of the\nhedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the\namount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect\nwas $731 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.\nFair Value Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our\nmarketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in the\nassessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OI&E, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the related\nhedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the\nexcluded component in OI&E.\nNet Investment Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks\nrelated to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude forward\npoints from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in OI&E.\nOther Derivatives\nWe enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to\nhedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the\nfunctional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting\nhedges are primarily recorded in OI&E along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and\nliabilities.\nWe also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates,\ncommodity prices, and credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns. From time to time, we enter into\nderivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains and losses arising from\nother derivatives are primarily reflected within the \u201cother\u201d component of OI&E. See Note 7 for further details.\n69."

We have agreed\nto defend and/or hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or\nout of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit\nthe time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered\ninto indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification\nobligations to our agents.\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification\nagreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the\npayments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations,\ncash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future\npayments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows\nin a particular period.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably\npossible.\nLegal Matters\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be\nreasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be\nestimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect\nthe amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses\ndisclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.\nCertain outstanding matters seek speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts, substantial\nchanges to our business practices and products, or structural remedies. Significant judgment is required to determine\nboth the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and we may be\nunable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of outstanding legal matters are\ninherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either individually or in aggregate, have a\nmaterial adverse effect.\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\nAntitrust Matters\nWe are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations as well as litigation on various competition\nmatters by regulatory authorities and private parties in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally, including the\nfollowing:\n\u2022 Shopping: In June 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google relating to its\ndisplay and ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European antitrust laws and imposed a \u20ac2.4\nbillion fine.

In the third quarter of 2024, we made a cash payment of $3.0 billion for the fine.\n\u2022 Android: In July 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google\u2019s Android-related\ndistribution agreements infringed European antitrust laws, imposed a \u20ac4.3 billion fine, and directed the\ntermination of the conduct at issue. We appealed the EC decision and implemented changes to certain of our\nAndroid distribution practices. In September 2022, the General Court affirmed the EC decision but reduced the\nfine from \u20ac4.3 billion to \u20ac4.1 billion. We subsequently appealed the General Court's affirmation of the EC\ndecision with the European Court of Justice, which remains pending. In 2018, we recognized a charge of\n$5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in 2022.\n\u2022 AdSense for Search: In March 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google's\nagreements with AdSense for Search partners infringed European antitrust laws, imposed a fine of \u20ac1.5 billion,\nand directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners' agreements, which we implemented prior to the\ndecision. In 2019, we recognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine and appealed the EC decision. In\nSeptember 2024, the General Court overturned the EC decision and annulled the \u20ac1.5 billion fine. The EC has\nappealed the General Court's decision with the European Court of Justice.\n\u2022 Search: In October 2020, the DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District\nCourt for the District of Columbia alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and\nSearch advertising. In August 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that Google\nviolated such U.S. antitrust laws. A separate proceeding is being held to determine remedies, the range of\nwhich vary widely. The DOJ has proposed a high level remedy framework, which includes alterations to our\nproducts and services and our business models and operations, including structural remedies, and/or our\ndistribution arrangements, among other changes, some of which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness. We have filed our own remedies proposal ahead of a hearing on remedies in April 2025. We expect\na decision likely in the second half of 2025, after which we intend to appeal.\nFurther, in June 2022, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and in October 2023, the\nJapanese Fair Trade Commission each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\nGiven the nature of these matters, we cannot estimate a possible loss.\n\u2022 Advertising Technology: In December 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state\ndeceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology, and a trial is scheduled for March 2025. Additionally,\nin January 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state Attorneys General, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to its\nadvertising technology, and a number of additional state Attorneys General subsequently joined the lawsuit.\nThe trial ended in September 2024, and we expect a decision in early 2025.\nFurther, in June 2023, the EC issued a Statement of Objections informing Google of its preliminary view that\nGoogle violated European antitrust laws relating to its advertising technology, to which we responded.\nGiven the nature of these matters, we cannot estimate a possible loss.\n\u2022 Google Play: In July 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the\nNorthern District of California alleging that Google\u2019s operation of Android and Google Play violated U.S.\nantitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In September 2023, we reached a settlement\nin principle with 50 state Attorneys General and three territories and recognized a charge. Final approval of the\nsettlement remains pending before the court. In May 2024, we funded the settlement amount to an escrow\nagent.\nIn December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict in Epic Games v. Google finding that Google violated\nU.S. antitrust laws related to Google Play's business. Epic did not seek monetary damages. The presiding\njudge issued a remedies decision in October 2024, ordering a variety of alterations to our business models and\noperations and contractual agreements for Android and Google Play. We are appealing the verdict and the trial\ncourt judge temporarily paused the implementation of the remedies while the Court of Appeals considers our\nrequest to pause implementation of the remedies pending the duration of the appeal. Given the nature of this\nmatter, we cannot estimate a possible loss.\n79."

Given the\npreliminary stages of this matter, we cannot estimate a possible loss.\nIn addition to these proceedings, private individual and collective actions that overlap with claims pursued by\nregulatory authorities are pending in the U.S. and in several other jurisdictions.\nWe believe we have strong arguments against these open claims and will defend ourselves vigorously. We\ncontinue to cooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\nPrivacy Matters\nWe are subject to a number of privacy-related laws and regulations, and we currently are party to a number of\nprivacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. For example, there are ongoing investigations and\nlitigation in the U.S. and the EU, including those relating to our collection and use of location information, alleged\nviolations of state biometric statutes, the choices we offer users, and advertising practices, which could result in\nsignificant fines, judgments, and product changes.\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these\nlawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders\npreventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change\nour business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for\nus and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly\nbecome an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can\nresult in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a\nprohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important\nproducts into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products. Further, our\ncustomers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions\nor otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\nOther\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and investigations, other proceedings,\nand consent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance,\nlabor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by\nadvertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example,\nwe periodically have data incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. Such claims, consent\norders, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings could result in substantial fines and\npenalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our products and services,\nalterations to our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences,\nall of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, some matters concern civil judgments that\ninclude compounding penalties imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts,\nincluding those of sanctioned parties. We do not expect these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse\neffect.\nNon-Income Taxes\nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The\nsubject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the\nsale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We accrue\nnon-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when\na loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of\nloss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of\nthese matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially different from our\nexpectations.\nSee Note 14 for information regarding income tax contingencies.\n80."

Stockholders' Equity\nClass A and Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock\nOur Board of Directors has authorized three classes of stock, Class A and Class B common stock, and Class C\ncapital stock. The rights of the holders of each class of our common and capital stock are identical, except with respect\nto voting. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock\nis entitled to 10 votes per share. Class C capital stock has no voting rights, except as required by applicable law.\nShares of Class B common stock may be converted at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically\nconvert upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock.\nShare Repurchases\nIn the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, we continued to repurchase both Class A and Class C\nshares in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its stockholders, taking into account the economic\ncost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading prices and volumes of the Class A and Class C\nshares. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, we repurchased $59.3 billion, $62.2 billion, and\n$62.0 billion, respectively, of Alphabet's Class A and Class C shares.\nIn April 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $70.0\nbillion of its Class A and Class C shares. As of December 31, 2024, $44.7 billion remained available for Class A and\nClass C share repurchases.\nThe following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 Year Ended December 31, 2024\nShares Amount Shares Amount\nClass A share repurchases 78 $ 9,316 73 $ 11,855\nClass C share repurchases 450 52,868 306 50,192\nTotal share repurchases(1) 528 $ 62,184 379 $ 62,047\n(1) Shares repurchased include unsettled repurchases.\nRepurchases are executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other\ninvestment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule\n10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date.\nDividends\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, total cash dividends, which were first paid in June 2024, were $3.5\nbillion, $519 million, and $3.3 billion for Class A, Class B, and Class C shares, respectively.\nThe company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future, subject to review and approval by the\ncompany\u2019s Board of Directors in its sole discretion.\nNote 12. Net Income Per Share\nWe compute net income per share of Class A, Class B, and Class C stock using the two-class method. Basic net\nincome per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net\nincome per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutive\nsecurities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of RSUs and other contingently issuable\nshares. The dilutive effect of outstanding RSUs and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings\nper share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A\nstock assumes the conversion of Class B stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B stock does not\nassume the conversion of those shares.\nIn accordance with our certificate of incorporation, the rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the\nholders of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Furthermore, there are\na number of safeguards built into our certificate of incorporation, as well as Delaware law, which preclude our Board of\nDirectors from declaring or paying unequal per share dividends on our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock.\nSpecifically, Delaware law provides that amendments to our certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of\nadversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a given class of stock must be approved by the class of stock\nadversely affected by the proposed amendment. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that before any\nsuch amendment may be put to a stockholder vote, it must be approved by the unanimous consent of our Board of\nDirectors.\n81."

It is more likely than not that the\nmajority of the net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized. The net operating loss carryforwards are subject to\nvarious annual limitations under the tax laws of the different jurisdictions.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our Federal and California research and development credit carryforwards for income\ntax purposes were approximately $700 million and $6.4 billion, respectively. If not utilized, the Federal R&D credit will\nbegin to expire in 2037 and the California R&D credit can be carried over indefinitely.

Our two\nmajor tax jurisdictions are the U.S. federal and Ireland. We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax\nreturns by the IRS and other tax authorities. The IRS is currently examining our 2016 through 2021 tax returns. We\nhave also received tax assessments in multiple foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or\npermanent establishment. We continue to defend such claims as presented.\nThe tax years 2016 through 2023 remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for\nIrish tax purposes. There are other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial\nstatements.\nWe regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the\nadequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax\nauthorities and the effect, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions.\nWe believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.\nHowever, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are\nresolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for\nincome taxes in the period such resolutions occur. Although the timing of resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is\nnot certain, we do not believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits from certain U.S. federal,\nstate, and non U.S. tax positions will materially change in the next 12 months.\nNote 15. Information about Segments and Geographic Areas\nWe report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:\n\u2022 Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Google Maps,\nGoogle Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; fees\nreceived for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and\nNFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One; the sale of apps and in-app purchases; and devices.\n\u2022 Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, applications, and other services for enterprise\ncustomers. Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from consumption-based fees and subscriptions\nreceived for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and\nother enterprise services.\n\u2022 Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from\nOther Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.\nRevenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering\nactivities, and devices, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the\nintegrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are\nmanaged centrally at a consolidated level. These costs, including the associated depreciation, are allocated to\noperating segments as a service cost generally based on usage, headcount, or revenue.\n87."

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in\nAugust 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc.\n(\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that\nprovide customers with infrastructure and platform services and collaboration tools; sales of other products and\nservices, such as apps and in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and fees received for\nsubscription-based products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated\nunder the variable interest and voting models. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUnaudited Interim Financial Information\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal\nrecurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of\nthe results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2022. We have made estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual\nresults could differ materially from these estimates.\nThese consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 filed with the SEC.\nNote 2.

Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer\ncontracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenues. The amount and timing of revenue\nrecognition for these commitments is largely driven by when our customers utilize services and our ability to deliver\nin accordance with relevant contract terms, which could affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when we expect\nto recognize such as revenues. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as\namounts that will be invoiced in future periods and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or\nless and cancellable contracts.\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance,\nincluding amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other.\nTotal deferred revenue as of December 31, 2021 was $3.8 billion, of which $1.4 billion was recognized as revenues\nduring the three months ended March 31, 2022.\nNote 3.

The fair value option was elected for these securities to align with the\nunrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts. Unrealized net losses related to debt securities still\nheld where we have elected the fair value option were $35 million and $236 million as of December 31, 2021 and\nMarch 31, 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, the fair value of these debt securities\nwas $4.7 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively.\nThe following tables summarize debt securities, for which we did not elect the fair value option, by significant\ninvestment categories (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2021\nGross Gross Cash and\nAdjusted Unrealized Unrealized Fair Cash Marketable\nCost Gains Losses Value Equivalents Securities\nLevel 2:\nTime deposits(1) $ 5,133 $ 0 $ 0 $ 5,133 $ 5,133 $ 0\nGovernment bonds 53,288 258 (238) 53,308 5 53,303\nCorporate debt securities 35,605 194 (223) 35,576 12 35,564\nMortgage-backed and asset-backed\nsecurities 18,829 96 (112) 18,813 0 18,813\nTotal $ 112,855 $ 548 $ (573) $ 112,830 $ 5,150 $ 107,680\n11"

Our share of gains and losses, including\nimpairments, are included as a component of other income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of\nIncome. See Note 6 for further details on other income (expense), net.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe enter into derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary\nrisk managed with derivative instruments is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the\nrisk that our cash flows, earnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to\nother risks and enhance investment returns.\nWe recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair\nvalue and classify the derivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts\n(an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values where both the\npurchased and written options are with the same counterparty. For other derivative contracts, we present at gross\nfair values. We primarily record changes in the fair value in the Consolidated Statements of Income as either other\nincome (expense), net, or revenues, or in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in AOCI, as discussed below.\nWe enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of\ntransactions with the same counterparty. Further, we enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for\ncollateral to be received or pledged when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from\ncontractually established thresholds. Cash collateral received related to derivative instruments under our collateral\nsecurity arrangements are included in other current assets with a corresponding liability. Cash and non-cash\ncollateral pledged related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements are included in other\ncurrent assets.\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge\ncertain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have\nmaturities of 24 months or less.\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and\nsubsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude the change in\nforward points and time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness. The initial value of the excluded\ncomponent is amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument and recognized in revenues.\nThe difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to revenues is\nrecorded in AOCI. If the hedged transactions become probable of not occurring, the corresponding amounts in AOCI\nare reclassified to other income (expense), net in the period of de-designation.\nAs of March 31, 2022, the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect\nwas $356 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings within the next 12 months.\n15"

We have agreed to hold certain parties\nharmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property\ninfringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which\nan indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification\nagreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification\nagreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, we have\na limited history of prior indemnification claims and the payments we have made under such agreements have not\nhad a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent\nthat valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.\nAs of March 31, 2022, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably\npossible.\nLegal Matters\nAntitrust Investigations\nOn November 30, 2010, the EC's Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various\nantitrust-related complaints against us.\nOn June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display\nand ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law.

            "text": "Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\nFrom time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on competition matters by\nregulatory authorities in the United States (U.S.), Europe, and other jurisdictions. In August 2019, we began\nreceiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) requesting information and\ndocuments relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our business. The DOJ and a number\nof state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit on October 20, 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws\nrelating to Search and Search advertising. Separately, on December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General\nfiled an antitrust complaint against Google in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that\nGoogle violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state deceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology. On\nJune 22, 2021, the EC opened a formal investigation into Google's advertising technology business practices. On\nJuly 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for\nthe Northern District of California, alleging that Google\u2019s operation of Android and Google Play violated U.S.\nantitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. We believe these complaints are without merit and\nwill defend ourselves vigorously. The DOJ, state Attorneys General, and EC continue their investigations into certain\naspects of our business. We continue to cooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other\nregulators around the world.\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in\nthese lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or\norders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have\nto change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss\nof revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has\nincreasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC\naction can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important\nmarket, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing\nmany important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against\ncertain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such\nclaims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In\naddition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a\nresult of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\nOther\nWe are also regularly subject to claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings,\nand consent decrees involving competition, intellectual property, privacy and cybersecurity, tax and related\ncompliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services\noffered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters.\nFor example, we currently have a number of privacy investigations and suits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. Such\nclaims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent decrees could result in\nsubstantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing auditing and monitoring obligations, changes to our\nproducts and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or\nother adverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating\nresults.\nWe have ongoing legal matters in Russia. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material\nadverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nCertain outstanding matters include speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts. We record a\nliability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably\nestimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we\ndisclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount\nof liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and\nmake adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being\nand the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters.\nWith respect to our outstanding matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range\nof reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of such\nmatters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.\n25"

The repurchase program does not have an expiration date.\nStock Split Effected in Form of Stock Dividend (\u201cStock Split\u201d)\nOn February 1, 2022, the company announced that the Board of Directors had approved and declared a 20-\nfor-one stock split in the form of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the company\u2019s Class A, Class\nB, and Class C stock. The Stock Split is subject to stockholder approval of an amendment to the company\u2019s\nAmended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Class A, Class\nB, and Class C stock to accommodate the Stock Split.\nIf approval is obtained, each of the company\u2019s stockholders of record at the close of business on July 1, 2022\n(the \u201cRecord Date\u201d), will receive, after the close of business on July 15, 2022, a dividend of 19 additional shares of\nthe same class of stock for every share held by such stockholder as of the Record Date.\n26"

For further details on\nour segments, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q.\nSeasonality and other\nOur advertising revenues are affected by seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and\nunderlying business trends, such as traditional retail seasonality. Additionally, our non-advertising revenues,\nincluding those generated from Google Cloud, Google Play, hardware, and YouTube, may be affected by\nfluctuations driven by changes in pricing, digital content releases, fee structures, new product and service launches,\nand other market dynamics, as well as seasonality.\nRevenues and Monetization Metrics\nGoogle Services\nGoogle Services revenues consist of revenues generated from advertising (\u201cGoogle advertising\u201d) as well as\nrevenues from other sources (\u201cGoogle other revenues\u201d).\nGoogle Advertising\nGoogle advertising revenues are comprised of the following:\n\u2022 Google Search & other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including\nrevenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search\nin browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and\nGoogle Play;\n\u2022 YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and\n\u2022 Google Network, which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob,\nAdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\nWe use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our\nadvertising revenues: paid clicks and cost-per-click pertain to traffic on Google Search & other properties, while\nimpressions and cost-per-impressions pertain to traffic on our Network partners\u2019 properties.\nPaid clicks represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users on Google\nsearch properties and other Google owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google\nPlay. Cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the\naverage amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.\nImpressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in\nAdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based\nrevenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for\neach impression displayed to users.\nAs our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring,\ngathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues\ngenerated by the corresponding click and impression activity.\nOur advertising revenue growth, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search &\nother properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties and the\ncorrelation between these items, have been affected and may continue to be affected by various factors, including:\n\u2022 advertiser competition for keywords;\n30"

We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues and non-GAAP percentage change in constant\ncurrency revenues for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period\ncomparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps\nimprove the ability to understand our performance because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that\nare not indicative of our core operating results.\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant\nperiod over period. We define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the effect of foreign\nexchange rate movements and hedging activities, and use it to determine the constant currency revenue\npercentage change on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current\nperiod revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects\nrealized in the current period.\n35"

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nFor quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, refer to Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and\nQualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2021.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the\neffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the\nend of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nBased on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of March 31,\n2022, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to\nprovide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the\nExchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s\nrules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our\nchief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required\ndisclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe rely extensively on information systems to manage our business and summarize and report operating\nresults. In 2019, we began a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system,\nwhich will replace much of our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain\nour financial records, enhance the flow of financial information, improve data management and provide timely\ninformation to our management team. The implementation is expected to continue in phases over the next few\nyears. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter\nended March 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control\nover financial reporting. However, as the phased implementation of the new ERP system continues, we will change\nour processes and procedures, which in turn, could result in changes to our internal control over financial reporting.\nAs such changes occur, we will evaluate quarterly whether such changes materially affect our internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nAs a result of COVID-19, our global workforce continued to operate primarily in a work from home environment\nfor the quarter ended March 31, 2022. While we continue to evolve our work model in response to the uneven\neffects of the ongoing pandemic around the world, we believe that our internal controls over financial reporting\ncontinue to be effective. We have continued to re-evaluate and refine our financial reporting process to provide\nreasonable assurance that we could report our financial results accurately and timely.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls\nand procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving\nthe desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that\nthere are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of\npossible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\n42"

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in\nAugust 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc.\n(\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that\nprovide enterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration\ntools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received\nfor subscription-based products.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated\nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUnaudited Interim Financial Information\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal\nrecurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of\nthe results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2023. We have made estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual\nresults could differ materially from these estimates.\nThese consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the SEC.\nChange in Accounting Estimate\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and\nadjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain\nnetwork equipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal\nyear 2023. Based on the carrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December 31, 2022, and\nthose placed in service during the quarter ended March 31, 2023, the effect of this change in estimate was a\nreduction in depreciation expense of $988 million and an increase in net income of $770 million, or $0.06 per basic\nand $0.06 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2023.\nStock Split Effected in the Form of a Stock Dividend (\u201cStock Split\u201d)\nOn July 15, 2022, we executed a 20-for-one stock split of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. All prior\nperiod references made to share or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and\napplicable disclosures prior to the effective date have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock\nSplit.\nPrior Period Reclassifications\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.\n10"

Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services\nthat have not yet been recognized as revenue. The amount and timing of revenue recognition for these\ncommitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our\ncustomers utilize services, which could affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when we expect to recognize\nsuch as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24\nmonths with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue\ncurrently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original\nexpected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.\nDeferred Revenues\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance,\nincluding amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other.\nTotal deferred revenue as of December 31, 2022 was $4.5 billion, of which $1.6 billion was recognized as revenues\nduring the three months ended March 31, 2023.\n11"

The fair value of non-marketable equity securities that\nhave been remeasured due to impairment are classified within Level 3.\nAs of March 31, 2023 the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $29.1 billion, of which\n$10.7 billion were re-measured at fair value during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and primarily classified\nas Level 2 investments.\n13"

We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance\ninvestment returns.\nWe recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the\nderivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy\ncomprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at\ngross fair values. The accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation.\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge\ncertain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have\nmaturities of 24 months or less.\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and\nsubsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points\nand time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life\nof the hedging instrument in revenues.

Fair value hedge amounts included in\nthe assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net, along with the offsetting\ngains and losses of the related hedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in other income (expense), net.\nNet Investment Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks\nrelated to our investment in foreign subsidiaries.

We exclude\nforward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in\nother income (expense), net.\nOther Derivatives\nWe enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to\nhedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the\nfunctional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting\nhedges are primarily recorded in other income (expense), net along with the foreign currency gains and losses on\nmonetary assets and liabilities.\nWe also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates,\ncommodity prices, credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns.

Variable Interest Entities (VIE)\nConsolidated VIEs\nWe consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of\noperations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.\nFor certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us and their creditors do not have recourse to\nus. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs\nwere $4.1 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs\nwere $2.6 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs that are\nincluded within Other Bets.\nTotal noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were $3.8 billion and $3.7 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023, respectively, of which $1.1 billion is redeemable noncontrolling interest\n(RNCI) for both periods. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to\nnoncontrolling interests was not material for any period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of\nOI&E. See Note 6 for further details on OI&E.\nUnconsolidated VIEs\nWe have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private\ncompanies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve\npower generation using renewable sources.\nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that\nwould significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results\nof operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We\naccount for these investments as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments.\nThe maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the\ninvestments and any future funding commitments. We have determined that the single source of our exposure to\nthese VIEs is our capital investments in them. The carrying value and maximum exposure of these unconsolidated\nVIEs were $2.7 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2022 and $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion,\nrespectively, as of March 31, 2023.\nNote 5. Debt\nShort-Term Debt\nWe have a debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net\nproceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as\nof December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023.\nOur short-term debt balance also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt.\n19"

If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be\nestimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could\naffect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible\nlosses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.\nCertain outstanding matters include speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts. Significant\njudgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss\nrelated to such matters, and we may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The\noutcomes of outstanding legal matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and\ncould, either individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect.\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\nAntitrust Investigations\nOn November 30, 2010, the EC's Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various\nantitrust-related complaints against us.\nOn June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display\nand ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law.

On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision to the\nGeneral Court, and on September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into\ncompliance with the EC's decision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2017.\nOn November 10, 2021, the General Court rejected our appeal, and we subsequently filed an appeal with the\nEuropean Court of Justice on January 20, 2022.\nOn July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google\u2019s Android-related distribution\nagreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a \u20ac4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30,\n2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision,\nand on October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution practices. On September\n14, 2022, the General Court reduced the fine from \u20ac4.3 billion to \u20ac4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal with\nthe European Court of Justice. In 2018, we recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by\n$217 million in 2022.\nOn March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that\nGoogle had with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a fine\nof \u20ac1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners'\nagreements, which we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed the EC decision, which\nremains pending. We recognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019.\nFrom time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on various competition\nmatters by regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally. For example:\n\u2022 In August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)\nrequesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our\nbusiness. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit on October 20, 2020 alleging\nthat Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising. Further, in June 2022,\nthe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the United Kingdom's Competition and\nMarkets Authority (CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\n\u2022 On December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state\ndeceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology. Additionally, on January 24, 2023, the DOJ, along\nwith a number of state Attorneys General, filed an antitrust complaint alleging that Google\u2019s digital\nadvertising technology products violate U.S. antitrust laws, and on April 17, 2023, a number of additional\nstate Attorneys General joined the complaint. The EC, the CMA, and the ACCC each opened a formal\ninvestigation into Google's advertising technology business practices on June 22, 2021, May 25, 2022, and\nJune 29, 2022, respectively.\n25"

As a result, we may have\nto change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss\nof revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has\nincreasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC\naction can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important\nmarket, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing\nmany important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against\ncertain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such\nclaims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In\naddition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a\nresult of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\nOther\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent\norders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and\nemployment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or\npublishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, we currently\nhave a number of privacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. We also periodically have\ndata incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. Such claims, lawsuits, regulatory and\ngovernment investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders could result in substantial fines and penalties,\ninjunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to\nour business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of\nwhich could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, civil judgments that include compounding\npenalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including\nthose of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.\nNon-Income Taxes\nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters.\nThe subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied\nto the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We\naccrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax\nauthorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and\nthe loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity\nand uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially\ndifferent from our expectations.\nFor information regarding income tax contingencies, see Note 13.\n26"

We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP\npercentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for\nfinancial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe\nthe presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting\nPrinciples (GAAP) results helps improve the ability to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects\nof foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant\nperiod over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate\nmovements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We use\nconstant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year\nbasis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year\ncomparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.\nConstant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period\nrevenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are\n36"

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in\nAugust 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc.\n(\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that\nprovide enterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration\ntools; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app\npurchases, and devices.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated\nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUnaudited Interim Financial Information\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal\nrecurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of\nthe results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2024. We have made estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual\nresults could differ materially from these estimates.\nThese consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update\n(ASU) 2023-07 \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\" which expands\nannual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about\nsignificant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2024, and for\ninterim periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential\neffect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 \"Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures\" to expand the disclosure requirements for income taxes, specifically related to the rate reconciliation\nand income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early\nadoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential effect that the updated standard will have on our\nfinancial statement disclosures.\nPrior Period Reclassifications\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.\n10"

Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services\nthat have not yet been recognized as revenue. The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue recognition for\nthese commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when\nour customers utilize services. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over\nthe next 24 months with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred\nrevenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with\nan original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.\nDeferred Revenues\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance,\nincluding amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google\nsubscriptions, platforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2023 was $5.0 billion, of which\n$2.4 billion was recognized as revenues during the three months ended March 31, 2024.\nNote 3.

The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities\nthat have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or\nLevel 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment\nare classified within Level 3. Our valuation methods include option pricing models, market comparable approach,\nand common stock equivalent method, which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the\ntransaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, expected time to exit, risk free rate, and the\nrights, and obligations of the securities we hold. These inputs significantly vary based on investment type.\nAs of March 31, 2024, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $31.4 billion, of which\n$13.6 billion were remeasured at fair value during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and primarily classified\nwithin Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy at the time of measurement.\n13"

We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance\ninvestment returns.\nWe recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the\nderivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy\ncomprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at\ngross fair values. The accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation.\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge\ncertain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States (U.S.) dollar. These\ncontracts have maturities of 24 months or less.\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and\nsubsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points\nand time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life\nof the hedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and\nthe amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.\nAs of March 31, 2024, the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect\nwas $128 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.\nFair Value Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our\nmarketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in\nthe assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OI&E, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the\nrelated hedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize\nchanges in the excluded component in OI&E.\nNet Investment Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks\nrelated to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of\nhedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment.

Variable Interest Entities (VIE)\nConsolidated VIEs\nWe consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of\noperations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.\nFor certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us, and their creditors do not have recourse to\nus. As of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs\nwere $4.9 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs\nwere $2.5 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs that are\nincluded within Other Bets.\nTotal noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were $3.4 billion and $3.2 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively, of which $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion is redeemable\nnoncontrolling interest (RNCI) as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively. NCI and RNCI are\nincluded within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was not material for any\nperiod presented and is included within the \"other\" component of OI&E. See Note 6 for further details on OI&E.\nUnconsolidated VIEs\nWe have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private\ncompanies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve\npower generation using renewable sources.\nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that\nwould significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results\nof operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We\naccount for these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments.\nThe maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the\ninvestments and any future funding commitments. The maximum exposure and carrying value of these\nunconsolidated VIEs were $5.7 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2023 and $6.9 billion and\n$5.3 billion, respectively, as of March 31, 2024. The difference between the maximum exposure and the carrying\nvalue relates primarily to future funding commitments.\nNote 5. Debt\nShort-Term Debt\nWe have a debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net\nproceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as\nof December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024.\nOur short-term debt balance also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt.\n19"

We have\nagreed to defend and/or hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or\ncovenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these\nagreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In\naddition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain\nsimilar indemnification obligations to our agents.\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification\nagreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the\npayments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the\nfuture, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations or cash flows in a particular period.\nAs of March 31, 2024, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably\npossible.\nLegal Matters\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be\nreasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be\nestimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could\naffect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible\nlosses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.\nCertain outstanding matters seek speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts, substantial\nchanges to our business practices and products, or structural remedies. Significant judgment is required to\ndetermine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and\nwe may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of outstanding legal\nmatters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either individually or in\naggregate, have a material adverse effect.\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\nAntitrust Matters\nOn November 30, 2010, the EC's Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various\nantitrust-related complaints against us.\n\u2022 On June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display\nand ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision\nimposed a \u20ac2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC\ndecision to the General Court, and on September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring\nshopping ads into compliance with the EC's decision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion for the fine in\nthe second quarter of 2017. On November 10, 2021, the General Court rejected our appeal, and we\nsubsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice on January 20, 2022.\n\u2022 On July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google\u2019s Android-related\ndistribution agreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a \u20ac4.3 billion ($5.1\nbillion as of June 30, 2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018,\nwe appealed the EC decision, and on October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android\ndistribution practices. On September 14, 2022, the General Court reduced the fine from \u20ac4.3 billion to\n\u20ac4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice. In 2018, we recognized a\ncharge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in 2022.\n\u2022 On March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that\nGoogle had with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision\nimposed a fine of \u20ac1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for\nSearch partners' agreements, which we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed\nthe EC decision. We recognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019.\n23"

In September 2023, we reached a settlement\nin principle with 50 state Attorneys General and three territories. The U.S. District Court subsequently vacated the\ntrial date with the states, and we expect any final approval of the settlement would come in 2024.\nIn December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict in a similar lawsuit in Epic Games v. Google. The jury\nfound that Google violated antitrust laws related to Google Play's business. Epic did not seek monetary damages.\nThe presiding judge will determine non-monetary remedies in 2024, and the range of potential remedies vary widely.\nWe plan to appeal.\nFrom time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on various competition\nmatters by regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally. Examples, for which given their\nnature we cannot estimate a possible loss include:\n\u2022 In August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)\nrequesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our\nbusiness. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the\nDistrict of Columbia on October 20, 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search\nand Search advertising. The trial ended on November 16, 2023, and we expect a decision in 2024. Further,\nin June 2022, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the United Kingdom's\nCompetition and Markets Authority (CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\n\u2022 On December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state\ndeceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology, and a trial is scheduled for March 2025.\nAdditionally, on January 24, 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state Attorneys General, filed an\nantitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging that Google\u2019s digital\nadvertising technology products violate U.S. antitrust laws, and on April 17, 2023, a number of additional\nstate Attorneys General joined the complaint. A trial is scheduled for September 2024. The EC, the CMA,\nand the ACCC each opened a formal investigation into Google's advertising technology business practices\non June 22, 2021, May 25, 2022, and June 29, 2022, respectively. On June 14, 2023, the EC issued a\nStatement of Objections (SO) informing Google of its preliminary view that Google violated European\nantitrust laws relating to its advertising technology. We responded to the SO on December 1, 2023.\n\u2022 In May 2022, the EC and the CMA each opened investigations into Google Play\u2019s business practices.\nKorean regulators are investigating Google Play's billing practices, including a formal review in May 2022 of\nGoogle's compliance with the new app store billing regulations.\nWe believe we have strong arguments against these claims and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue\nto cooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\nPrivacy Matters\nWe are subject to a number of privacy-related laws and regulations, and we currently are party to a number of\nprivacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. For example, there are ongoing investigations\nand litigation in the U.S. and the European Union, including those relating to our collection and use of location\ninformation and advertising practices, which could result in significant fines, judgments, and product changes.\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in\nthese lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or\norders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have\nto change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss\nof revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has\nincreasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC\naction can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important\nmarket, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing\nmany important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\n24"

Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; fees\nreceived for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium,\nand NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One; the sale of apps and in-app purchases and devices.\n\u2022 Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for\nenterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from consumption-based fees and\nsubscriptions received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and\ncollaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\n\u2022 Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues\nfrom Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.\nRevenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering\nactivities, and devices, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the\nintegrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are\nmanaged centrally at a consolidated level. These costs, including the associated depreciation and impairment, are\nallocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage, headcount, or revenue.\nCertain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs\nprimarily include AI-focused shared R&D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; corporate\ninitiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and\nlegal costs, including certain fines and settlements. Charges associated with employee severance and office space\nreductions during 2023 and employee severance in the first quarter of 2024, were not allocated to our segments.\nAdditionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are not allocated to our segments.\nOur operating segments are not evaluated using asset information.\n27"

Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled\nmeasures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table presents the foreign currency exchange effect on international revenues and total revenues\n(in millions, except percentages):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2024\n% Change from Prior Period\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, Constant Less Constant\nLess FX Currency As Hedging Less FX Currency\n2023 2024 Effect Revenues Reported Effect Effect Revenues\nUnited States $ 32,864 $ 38,737 $ 0 $ 38,737 18 % 0 % 18 %\nEMEA 21,078 23,788 204 23,584 13 % 1 % 12 %\nAPAC 11,681 13,289 (439) 13,728 14 % (4) % 18 %\nOther Americas 4,080 4,653 (152) 4,805 14 % (4) % 18 %\nRevenues, excluding hedging\neffect 69,703 80,467 (387) 80,854 15 % (1) % 16 %\nHedging gains (losses) 84 72\nTotal revenues(1) $ 69,787 $ 80,539 $ 80,854 15 % 0 % (1) % 16 %\n(1) Total constant currency revenues of $80.9 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased $11.2 billion\ncompared to $69.7 billion in revenues, excluding hedging effect, for the three months ended March 31, 2023.\nEMEA revenue growth was favorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to\nthe U.S. dollar weakening relative to the Euro, partially offset by the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Turkish\nlira.\nAPAC revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due\nto the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Japanese yen.\nOther Americas revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates,\nprimarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Argentine peso.\n35"

The TAC rate decreased from 21.5% to 21.0% from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2024 primarily due to a revenue mix shift from Google Network properties to Google\nSearch & other properties. The TAC rate on Google Search & other revenues was substantially consistent from the\nthree months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months ended March 31, 2024. The TAC rate on Google Network\nrevenues reflected a slight increase from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months ended March\n31, 2024 due to a combination of factors, none of which were individually significant.\nThe increase in other cost of revenues from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months\nended March 31, 2024 was primarily due to increases in content acquisition costs, largely for YouTube, and\ndepreciation expense. These increases were partially offset by decreases in compensation expenses, largely the\nresult of a reduction in employee severance and related charges of $308 million, and charges related to our office\nspace optimization efforts of $220 million.\nResearch and Development\nThe following table presents R&D expenses (in millions, except percentages):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2023 2024\nResearch and development expenses $ 11,468 $ 11,903\nResearch and development expenses as a percentage of revenues 16 % 15 %\nR&D expenses increased $435 million from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months\nended March 31, 2024, primarily driven by increases in depreciation expense of $308 million and third-party\nservices fees of $253 million, partially offset by a decrease in charges associated with our office space optimization\nefforts of $247 million. Additionally, a decrease in compensation expenses of $64 million was primarily the result of a\nreduction in employee severance and related charges of $588 million.

RISK FACTORS\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described in\nPart I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of\nour stock. Below are material changes to our risk factors since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\nRisks Specific to our Company\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising. Reduced spending by advertisers,\na loss of partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to\ncustomize ads could harm our business.\nWe generated more than 75% of total revenues from online advertising in 2023. Many of our advertisers,\ncompanies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their\ncontracts with us at any time. These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more\nvalue (such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more\neffective monetization) than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy\npractices, such as our initiatives to phase out third-party cookies (which remain subject to review, affecting the\ntiming), as well as changes to other companies\u2019 advertising and/or data privacy practices have in the past, and may\nin the future, affect the advertising that we are able to provide. In addition, technologies have been developed that\nmake customized ads more difficult, or that block the display of ads altogether, and some providers of online\nservices have integrated these technologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of third-\nparty digital advertising. Failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively and competitively\ncould harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions. Adverse\nmacroeconomic conditions have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in\nfluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and\noperating results.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Stock\nWe cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program or dividend program will be continuously\nactive or fully consummated or will enhance long-term stockholder value, and share repurchases or\ndividends could increase the volatility of our stock prices and could diminish our cash reserves.\nWe engage in share repurchases of our Class A and Class C stock from time to time in accordance with\nauthorizations from the Board of Directors of Alphabet. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date\nand does not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of\nshares. In April 2024, we announced the approval of a cash dividend to our Class A, Class B and Class C\nstockholders. Any and all future cash dividends are subject to declaration by the Board of Directors at their sole\ndiscretion, and in accordance with the requirements of any applicable laws, rules and regulations, including the\nDelaware General Corporation Law. Our cash dividend program does not require, and our Board of Directors may\nnot declare, a cash dividend each quarter, and does not obligate our Board of Directors to declare a dividend in any\nspecific dollar amount per share. Further, our share repurchases or dividends could affect our share trading prices,\nincrease their volatility, reduce our cash reserves and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may\nresult in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock.\nThe trading price for our Class A stock and non-voting Class C stock may continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our stock has at times experienced significant volatility and may continue to be volatile. In\naddition to the factors discussed in this report, the trading prices of our Class A stock and Class C stock have\nfluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate widely, in response to various factors, including, among others, the size or\ncontinuity of either our share repurchase or dividend programs, the activities of our peers and changes in broader\n43"

This approval covers both performance stock unit awards and Google stock unit\nawards, and applies both to currently outstanding and future equity awards. For the avoidance of doubt, the\ncorresponding amendments to the respective stock unit grant agreements will apply both to currently outstanding\ngrant agreements and all future grant agreements. As stock units are not outstanding shares of stock and thus\nwould not otherwise be entitled to participate in any dividends (including the one referenced above), the crediting of\ndividend equivalent units is intended to preserve the equity-based incentives intended by the Company when the\nstock units were granted and to treat the holders of stock units consistently with all stockholders.\n44"

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in\nAugust 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc.\n(\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that\nprovide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure, platform services, and applications; sales of other\nproducts and services, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and\ndevices.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated\nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUnaudited Interim Financial Information\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal\nrecurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of\nthe results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2025. We have made estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual\nresults could differ materially from these estimates.\nThese consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 filed with the SEC.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update\n(ASU) 2023-09 \"Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\" to expand the disclosure\nrequirements for income taxes. Upon adoption we will be required to disclose additional specified categories in the\nrate reconciliation in both percentage and dollar amounts. We will also be required to disclose the amount of income\ntaxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction, among other disclosure requirements. The standard is effective for our\n2025 annual period and can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We are currently assessing the effect\nthat the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03 \"Income Statement: Reporting Comprehensive Income-\nExpense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40)\" to improve the disclosures about an entity\u2019s expenses.\nUpon adoption, we will be required to disclose in the notes to the financial statements a disaggregation of certain\nexpense categories included within the expense captions on the face of the income statement. The standard is\neffective for our 2027 annual period, and our interim periods beginning in 2028, with early adoption permitted. The\nstandard can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We are currently assessing adoption timing and the\neffect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\nPrior Period Reclassifications\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.\n10"

Revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that\nhave not yet been recognized as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately 55% of the revenue backlog as\nrevenues over the next 24 months with the remainder to be recognized thereafter. The estimated revenue backlog\nand timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with\nrelevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services. Revenue backlog includes related deferred\nrevenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with\nan original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.\nDeferred Revenues\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance,\nincluding amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google\nsubscriptions, platforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2024 was $6.0 billion, of which\n$2.6 billion was recognized as revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2025. Total deferred revenue as of\nMarch 31, 2025 was $6.6 billion.\nNote 3.

The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities\nthat have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or\nLevel 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment\nare classified within Level 3. Our valuation methods include option pricing models, market comparable approach,\nand common stock equivalent method, which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the\ntransaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, expected time to exit, risk free rate, and the\nrights, and obligations of the securities we hold. These inputs vary significantly based on investment type.\nAs of March 31, 2025, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $48.6 billion, of which\n$25.0 billion were remeasured at fair value during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and were primarily\nclassified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy at the time of measurement.\n13"

Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of\nhedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude\nforward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in\nOI&E.\nOther Derivatives\nWe enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to\nhedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the\nfunctional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting\nhedges are primarily recorded in OI&E along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and\nliabilities.\nWe also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates,\ncommodity prices, and credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns. From time to time, we enter into\nderivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains and losses arising\nfrom other derivatives are primarily reflected within the \u201cother\u201d component of OI&E. See Note 7 for further details.\n16"

As of December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs\nwere $8.7 billion and $7.8 billion, respectively, and are primarily included in cash and cash equivalents on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, liabilities for which creditors only\nhave recourse to the VIEs were $2.3 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing\noperations of certain VIEs that are included within Other Bets.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, total noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated\nsubsidiaries were $4.2 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively, of which $1.1 billion was redeemable noncontrolling\ninterests (RNCI) in each period.

Net loss attributable to\nnoncontrolling interests was not material for any period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of\nOI&E. See Note 7 for further details on OI&E.\nUnconsolidated VIEs\nWe have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private\ncompanies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve\npower generation using renewable sources.\nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that\nwould significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results\nof operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We\naccount for these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments, which\nare included within non-marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Commitments and Contingencies\nCommitments\nWe have content licensing agreements with future fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments of $8.6 billion as\nof March 31, 2025, of which the majority is paid quarterly through the first quarter of 2030.\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate\nactivities, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network partners, distribution partners,\ncustomers of Google Cloud offerings, lessors, and service providers with respect to certain matters. We have\nagreed to defend and/or indemnify certain parties against losses arising from a breach of representations or\ncovenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these\nagreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In\naddition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain\nsimilar indemnification obligations to our agents.\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification\nagreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the\npayments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the\nfuture, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations or cash flows in a particular period.\nAs of March 31, 2025, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably\npossible.\nLegal Matters\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be\nreasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be\nestimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could\naffect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible\nlosses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.\nCertain outstanding matters seek speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts, substantial\nchanges to our business practices and products, or structural remedies. Significant judgment is required to\ndetermine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and\nwe may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of outstanding legal\nmatters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either individually or in\naggregate, have a material adverse effect.\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\nAntitrust Matters\nWe are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations as well as litigation on various competition\nmatters by regulatory authorities and private parties in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally, including\nthe following:\n\u2022 Shopping: In June 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google relating to its\ndisplay and ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European antitrust laws and imposed a\n\u20ac2.4 billion fine. In 2024, we made a cash payment of $3.0 billion for the fine.\n\u2022 Android: In July 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google\u2019s Android-related\ndistribution agreements infringed European antitrust laws, imposed a \u20ac4.3 billion fine, and directed the\ntermination of the conduct at issue. We appealed the EC decision and implemented changes to certain of\nour Android distribution practices. In September 2022, the General Court affirmed the EC decision but\nreduced the fine from \u20ac4.3 billion to \u20ac4.1 billion. We subsequently appealed the General Court's affirmation\nof the EC decision with the European Court of Justice, which remains pending. In 2018, we recognized a\ncharge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in 2022.\n\u2022 AdSense for Search: In March 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google's\nagreements with AdSense for Search partners infringed European antitrust laws, imposed a fine of \u20ac1.5\nbillion, and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners' agreements, which we implemented\n25"

In September 2024, the General Court overturned the EC decision and annulled the \u20ac1.5 billion\nfine. The EC has appealed the General Court's decision with the European Court of Justice.\n\u2022 Search: In October 2020, the DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search\nand Search advertising. In August 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that Google\nviolated such U.S. antitrust laws. A separate proceeding is being held to determine remedies, the range of\nwhich vary widely. The DOJ has proposed a high level remedy framework, which includes alterations to our\nproducts and services and our business models and operations, including structural remedies, and/or our\ndistribution arrangements, among other changes, some of which could have a material adverse effect on\nour business. We have filed our own remedies proposal ahead of a hearing on remedies in April 2025. We\nexpect a decision likely in the second half of 2025, after which we intend to appeal.\nFurther, in June 2022, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and in October 2023, the\nJapanese Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\nIn April 2025, the JFTC issued a cease-and-desist order requiring us to make changes to our Android\nagreements to ensure they are consistent with Japanese antitrust law. The JFTC did not impose monetary\npenalties. We are constructively engaging with JFTC regarding compliance with the order.\nGiven the nature of these matters, we cannot estimate a possible loss.\n\u2022 Advertising Technology: In December 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as\nstate deceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology, and a trial is scheduled for August 2025.\nAdditionally, in January 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state Attorneys General, filed a lawsuit in the\nU.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating\nto its advertising technology, and a number of additional state Attorneys General subsequently joined the\nlawsuit. In April 2025, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia issued a mixed decision in\nthe DOJ case against Google, ruling that the DOJ failed to show that Google\u2019s advertiser tools or\nacquisitions of DoubleClick and AdMeld were anticompetitive, but that Google\u2019s publisher tools violated\nantitrust laws by excluding rivals. We plan to appeal the adverse portion of this decision.\nFurther, in June 2023, the EC issued a Statement of Objections informing Google of its preliminary view that\nGoogle violated European antitrust laws relating to its advertising technology, to which we responded. In\nSeptember 2024, the UK also issued a Statement of Objections on similar grounds, to which we responded.\nGiven the nature of these matters, we cannot estimate a possible loss.\n\u2022 Google Play: In July 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for\nthe Northern District of California alleging that Google\u2019s operation of Android and Google Play violated U.S.\nantitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In September 2023, we reached a\nsettlement in principle with 50 state Attorneys General and three territories and recognized a charge. Final\napproval of the settlement remains pending before the court. In May 2024, we funded the settlement\namount to an escrow agent.\nIn December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict in Epic Games v. Google finding that Google\nviolated U.S. antitrust laws related to Google Play's business. Epic did not seek monetary damages. The\npresiding judge issued a remedies decision in October 2024, ordering a variety of alterations to our\nbusiness models and operations and contractual agreements for Android and Google Play. We are\nappealing the verdict and the trial court judge temporarily paused the implementation of the remedies while\nthe Court of Appeals considers our request to pause implementation of the remedies pending the duration\nof the appeal. Given the nature of this matter, we cannot estimate a possible loss.\n\u2022 European Digital Markets Act: In March 2024, the EC opened two investigations regarding Google's\ncompliance with certain provisions of EU's Digital Markets Act relating to Google Play and Search. In March\n2025, the EC issued preliminary findings of non-compliance in both investigations, to which we plan to\nrespond in the coming weeks. Given the preliminary stages of this matter, we cannot estimate a possible\nloss.\nIn addition to these antitrust proceedings, private individual and collective actions that overlap with claims\npursued by regulatory authorities are pending in the U.S. and in several other jurisdictions, including across Europe.\nGiven the nature of these matters, we cannot estimate a possible loss.\n26"

We\ncontinue to cooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\nPrivacy Matters\nWe are subject to a number of privacy-related laws and regulations, and we currently are party to a number of\nprivacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. For example, there are ongoing investigations\nand litigation in the U.S. and the EU, including those relating to our collection and use of location information,\nalleged violations of state biometric statutes, the choices we offer users, and advertising practices, which could\nresult in significant fines, judgments, and product changes.\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in\nthese lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or\norders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have\nto change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss\nof revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has\nincreasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC\naction can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important\nmarket, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing\nmany important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\nFurther, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a\nresult of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\nOther\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and investigations, other proceedings,\nand consent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related\ncompliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services\noffered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters.\nFor example, we periodically have data incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. Such\nclaims, consent orders, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings could result in\nsubstantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our\nproducts and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or\nother adverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating\nresults.\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, some matters concern civil judgments that\ninclude compounding penalties imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts,\nincluding those of sanctioned parties. We do not expect these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse\neffect.\nNon-Income Taxes\nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters.\nThe subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied\nto the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We\naccrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax\nauthorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and\nthe loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity\nand uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially\ndifferent from our expectations.\nSee Note 14 for information regarding income tax contingencies.\n27"

We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP\npercentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for\nfinancial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe\nthe presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to\nunderstand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of\nour core operating results.\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant\nperiod over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency\nexchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated\nlevel. We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a\nyear-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior\nyear comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.\nConstant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period\nrevenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are\ntranslated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of\nboth periods.\nThese results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with\nGAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled\nmeasures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\n38"

We subsequently appealed the General Court's affirmation of the EC with the European Court of\nJustice, which remains pending.\nIn September 2024, the EU's General Court overturned the 2019 decision and annulled the \u20ac1.5 billion fine.\nThe EC has appealed the General Court's decision to the European Court of Justice.\nWe included the outstanding EC fines, including any under appeal, in accrued expenses and other current\nliabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For additional information, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nTaxes\nAs of March 31, 2025, we had income taxes payable of $2.7 billion related to a one-time transition tax payable\nincurred as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which is due in 2025. We also had long-term taxes payable\nof $9.8 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of March 31, 2025.\nPurchase Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations\nAs of March 31, 2025, we had material purchase commitments and other contractual obligations of $62.1\nbillion, of which $41.5 billion was short-term. These amounts primarily consist of purchase orders for certain\ntechnical infrastructure as well as the non-cancelable portion or the minimum cancellation fee in certain agreements\nrelated to commitments to purchase licenses, including content licenses, inventory, and network capacity. For those\nagreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities\nand/or pricing as of March 31, 2025. In certain instances, the amount of our contractual obligations may change\nbased on the expected timing of order fulfillment from our suppliers. For more information related to our content\nlicenses, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report\non Form 10-Q.\nIn addition, we regularly enter into multi-year, non-cancellable agreements to purchase renewable energy and\nenergy attributes, such as renewable energy certificates. These agreements do not include a minimum dollar\ncommitment. The amounts to be paid under these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated\nand are not readily determinable.\nWe may experience increases in the costs associated with our purchase commitments and other contractual\nobligations as a result of ongoing developments surrounding international trade.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in\nAugust 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc.\n(\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that\nprovide customers with infrastructure and platform services and collaboration tools; sales of other products and\nservices, such as apps and in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and fees received for\nsubscription-based products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated\nunder the variable interest and voting models. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUnaudited Interim Financial Information\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal\nrecurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of\nthe results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2022. We have made estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual\nresults could differ materially from these estimates.\nThese consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 filed with the SEC.\nStock Split Effected in the Form of a Stock Dividend (\u201cStock Split\u201d)\nOn February 1, 2022, the company announced that the Board of Directors had approved and declared a 20-\nfor-one stock split in the form of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the company\u2019s Class A, Class\nB, and Class C stock. The Stock Split had a record date of July 1, 2022 and an effective date of July 15, 2022. The\npar value per share of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock remains unchanged at $0.001 per share after the\nStock Split. All references made to share or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial\nstatements and applicable disclosures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split.\nNote 2.

Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer\ncontracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenues. The amount and timing of revenue\nrecognition for these commitments is largely driven by when our customers utilize services and our ability to deliver\nin accordance with relevant contract terms, which could affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when we expect\nto recognize such as revenues. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as\namounts that will be invoiced in future periods and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or\nless and cancellable contracts.\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance,\nincluding amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other.\nTotal deferred revenue as of December 31, 2021 was $3.8 billion, of which $2.1 billion was recognized as revenues\nduring the six months ended June 30, 2022.\nNote 3. Financial Instruments\nDebt Securities\nWe classify our marketable debt securities, which are accounted for as available-for-sale, within Level 2 in the\nfair value hierarchy because we use quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and\nmodels utilizing market observable inputs to determine fair value.\nFor certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value\nare recorded in other income (expense), net. The fair value option was elected for these securities to align with the\nunrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts. Unrealized net losses related to debt securities still\nheld where we have elected the fair value option were $35 million and $602 million as of December 31, 2021 and\nJune 30, 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2022, the fair value of these debt securities\nwas $4.7 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively.\nThe following tables summarize debt securities, for which we did not elect the fair value option, by significant\ninvestment categories (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2021\nGross Gross Cash and\nAdjusted Unrealized Unrealized Fair Cash Marketable\nCost Gains Losses Value Equivalents Securities\nLevel 2:\nTime deposits(1) $ 5,133 $ 0 $ 0 $ 5,133 $ 5,133 $ 0\nGovernment bonds 53,288 258 (238) 53,308 5 53,303\nCorporate debt securities 35,605 194 (223) 35,576 12 35,564\nMortgage-backed and asset-backed\nsecurities 18,829 96 (112) 18,813 0 18,813\nTotal $ 112,855 $ 548 $ (573) $ 112,830 $ 5,150 $ 107,680\n12"

Our share of gains and losses, including\nimpairments, are included as a component of other income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of\nIncome. See Note 6 for further details on other income (expense), net.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe enter into derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary\nrisk managed with derivative instruments is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the\nrisk that our cash flows, earnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to\nother risks and enhance investment returns.\nWe recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair\nvalue and classify the derivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts\n(an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values where both the\npurchased and written options are with the same counterparty. For other derivative contracts, we present at gross\nfair values. We primarily record changes in the fair value in the Consolidated Statements of Income as either other\nincome (expense), net, or revenues, or in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in AOCI, as discussed below.\nWe enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of\ntransactions with the same counterparty. Further, we enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for\ncollateral to be received or pledged when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from\ncontractually established thresholds. Cash collateral received related to derivative instruments under our collateral\nsecurity arrangements are included in other current assets with a corresponding liability. Cash and non-cash\ncollateral pledged related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements are included in other\ncurrent assets.\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge\ncertain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have\nmaturities of 24 months or less.\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and\nsubsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude the change in\nforward points and time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness. The initial value of the excluded\ncomponent is amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument and recognized in revenues.\nThe difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to revenues is\nrecorded in AOCI. If the hedged transactions become probable of not occurring, the corresponding amounts in AOCI\nare reclassified to other income (expense), net in the period of de-designation.\nAs of June 30, 2022, the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect was\n$1.1 billion, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings within the next 12 months.\n16"

Contingencies\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate\nactivities, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network partners, customers of Google Cloud\nofferings, lessors, and service providers with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to hold certain parties\nharmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property\ninfringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which\nan indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification\nagreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification\nagreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, we have\na limited history of prior indemnification claims and the payments we have made under such agreements have not\nhad a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent\nthat valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.\nAs of June 30, 2022, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably\npossible.\nLegal Matters\nAntitrust Investigations\nOn November 30, 2010, the EC's Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various\nantitrust-related complaints against us.\nOn June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display\nand ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a\n\u20ac2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine.

We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2017.\nOn November 10, 2021, the General Court rejected our appeal, and we subsequently filed an appeal with the\nEuropean Court of Justice on January 20, 2022.\nOn July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google\u2019s Android-related distribution\nagreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a \u20ac4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30,\n2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision,\nwhich remains pending. On October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution\npractices. We recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2018.\nOn March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that\nGoogle had with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a fine\nof \u20ac1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners'\nagreements, which we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed the EC decision, which\nremains pending. We recognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019.\nWhile each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities\non our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines.\nFrom time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on various competition\nmatters by regulatory authorities in the United States (U.S.), Europe, and other jurisdictions globally. For example:\n\u2022 In August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)\nrequesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our\nbusiness. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit on October 20, 2020 alleging\nthat Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising. Further, in June 2022,\nthe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the United Kingdom's Competition and\nMarkets Authority (CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\n\u2022 On December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state\ndeceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology. The DOJ's investigation of similar issues remains\nongoing. The EC, the CMA, and the ACCC each opened a formal investigation into Google's advertising\ntechnology business practices on June 22, 2021, May 25, 2022, and June 29, 2022, respectively.\n\u2022 On July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court\nfor the Northern District of California, alleging that Google\u2019s operation of Android and Google Play violated\nU.S. antitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In May 2022, the EC and the CMA\neach opened a formal investigation into Google Play\u2019s business practices. Korean regulators are\ninvestigating Google Play's billing practices, most recently opening a formal review in May 2022 of Google's\ncompliance with the new app store billing regulations.\nWe believe these complaints are without merit and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue to cooperate\nwith federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in\nthese lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or\norders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have\nto change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss\nof revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has\nincreasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC\naction can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important\nmarket, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing\nmany important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against\ncertain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such\nclaims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In\naddition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a\nresult of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\n27"

Such\nclaims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent decrees could result in\nsubstantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing auditing and monitoring obligations, changes to our\nproducts and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or\nother adverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating\nresults.\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nCertain outstanding matters include speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts. We record a\nliability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably\nestimated.

However, the outcome of such\nmatters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\nNon-Income Taxes\nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters.\nThe subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied\nto the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We\naccrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax\nauthorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.

See Note 1 for\nfurther details.\nShare Repurchases\nIn April 2021, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $50.0 billion of its\nClass C stock. In July 2021, the Board of Directors of Alphabet approved an amendment to the April 2021\nauthorization, permitting the company to repurchase both Class A and Class C shares in a manner deemed in the\nbest interest of the company and its stockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market\nconditions, including the relative trading prices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. The repurchases\nfrom the April 2021 authorization were completed during the second quarter of 2022.\nIn April 2022, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional\n$70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares.

The associated costs, including depreciation and impairment, are\nallocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage or headcount.\nUnallocated corporate costs primarily include corporate initiatives, corporate shared costs, such as finance and\nlegal, including certain fines and settlements, as well as costs associated with certain shared R&D activities.\nAdditionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are included in corporate costs.\nOur operating segments are not evaluated using asset information.\nThe following table presents information about our segments (in millions):\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n2021 2022 2021 2022\nRevenues:\nGoogle Services $ 57,067 $ 62,841 $ 108,245 $ 124,313\nGoogle Cloud 4,628 6,276 8,675 12,097\nOther Bets 192 193 390 633\nHedging gains (losses) (7) 375 (116) 653\nTotal revenues $ 61,880 $ 69,685 $ 117,194 $ 137,696\n31"

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS\nOF OPERATIONS\nPlease read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together\nwith \"Note About Forward-Looking Statements\" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes\nincluded under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2021, including Part I, Item 1A \"Risk Factors.\"\nUnderstanding Alphabet\u2019s Financial Results\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses \u2014 the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments,\nGoogle Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Other\nBets include earlier stage technologies that are further afield from our core Google business. For further details on\nour segments, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q.\nSeasonality and other\nOur advertising revenues are affected by seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and\nunderlying business trends, such as traditional retail seasonality. Additionally, our non-advertising revenues,\nincluding those generated from Google Cloud, Google Play, hardware, and YouTube, may be affected by\nfluctuations driven by changes in pricing, digital content releases, fee structures, new product and service launches,\nand other market dynamics, as well as seasonality.\nRevenues and Monetization Metrics\nGoogle Services\nGoogle Services revenues consist of revenues generated from advertising (\u201cGoogle advertising\u201d) as well as\nrevenues from other sources (\u201cGoogle other revenues\u201d).\nGoogle Advertising\nGoogle advertising revenues are comprised of the following:\n\u2022 Google Search & other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including\nrevenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search\nin browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and\nGoogle Play;\n\u2022 YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and\n\u2022 Google Network, which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob,\nAdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\nWe use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our\nadvertising revenues: paid clicks and cost-per-click pertain to traffic on Google Search & other properties, while\nimpressions and cost-per-impressions pertain to traffic on our Network partners\u2019 properties.\nPaid clicks represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users on Google\nsearch properties and other Google owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google\nPlay. Cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the\naverage amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.\nImpressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in\nAdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based\nrevenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for\neach impression displayed to users.\nAs our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring,\ngathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues\ngenerated by the corresponding click and impression activity.\nOur advertising revenue growth, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search &\nother properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties and the\ncorrelation between these items, have been affected and may continue to be affected by various factors, including:\n\u2022 advertiser competition for keywords;\n33"

This reflects, when rounding to the\none decimal place, the percentage change in consolidated revenues and consolidated constant currency revenues year\nover year of 12.6% and 16.3%, respectively.\n\u2022 Revenues were $69.7 billion, an increase of 13% year over year, primarily driven by an increase in Google\nServices segment revenues of $5.8 billion or 10% and an increase in Google Cloud segment revenues of\n$1.6 billion or 36%.\n\u2022 Cost of revenues was $30.1 billion, an increase of 15% year over year, driven by increases in other costs of\nrevenues and TAC.\n\u2022 Operating expenses were $20.1 billion, an increase of 24% year over year, primarily driven by increases in\ncompensation due to headcount growth, professional services fees and advertising and promotional\nexpenses. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in charges related to legal matters.\nOther information\n\u2022 On July 15, 2022, the company executed a 20-for-one stock split with a record date of July 1, 2022, effected\nin the form of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the company's Class A, Class B, and\nClass C stock.

See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.\n\u2022 Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, we suspended the vast majority of our commercial activities in Russia\nand effectively ceased business activities of our Russian entity. The ongoing effect of these direct actions on\nour financial results was not material. The broader economic effects resulting from the war in Ukraine on our\nfuture financial results may be unpredictable.\n\u2022 Repurchases of Class A and Class C shares were $15.2 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2022.\nIn April 2022, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional\n$70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares.

We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues and non-GAAP percentage change in constant\ncurrency revenues for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period\ncomparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps\nimprove the ability to understand our performance because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that\nare not indicative of our core operating results.\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant\nperiod over period. We define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the effect of foreign\nexchange rate movements and hedging activities, and use it to determine the constant currency revenue\npercentage change on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current\nperiod revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects\nrealized in the current period.\nConstant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period\nrevenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are\ntranslated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of\nboth periods.\nThese results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with\nGAAP.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the\neffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the\nend of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nBased on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of June 30,\n2022, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to\nprovide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the\nExchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s\nrules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our\nchief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required\ndisclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe rely extensively on information systems to manage our business and summarize and report operating\nresults. In 2019, we began a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system,\nwhich will replace much of our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain\nour financial records, enhance the flow of financial information, improve data management and provide timely\ninformation to our management team. To date, significant progress has been made with the implementation of\nvarious modules. Additional implementation activities are expected to continue in phases over the next few years.\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended\nJune 30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over\nfinancial reporting. However, as the phased implementation of the new ERP system continues, we will change our\nprocesses and procedures, which in turn, could result in changes to our internal control over financial reporting. As\nsuch changes occur, we will evaluate quarterly whether such changes materially affect our internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls\nand procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving\nthe desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that\nthere are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of\npossible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\n46"

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August\n2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\")\nbecame the successor issuer to Google.\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that\nprovide enterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration\ntools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received\nfor subscription-based products.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated\nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUnaudited Interim Financial Information\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal\nrecurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of\nthe results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2023. We have made estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual\nresults could differ materially from these estimates.\nThese consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the SEC.\nChange in Accounting Estimate\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and\nadjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain\nnetwork equipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal\nyear 2023. Based on the carrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December 31, 2022, and\nthose placed in service during the six months ended June 30, 2023, the effect of this change in estimate was a\nreduction in depreciation expense of $966 million and $2.0 billion and an increase in net income of $752 million and\n$1.5 billion, or $0.06 and $0.12 per basic and $0.06 and $0.12 per diluted share, for the three and six months ended\nJune 30, 2023, respectively.\nPrior Period Reclassifications\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.\n11"

Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services\nthat have not yet been recognized as revenue. The amount and timing of revenue recognition for these\ncommitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our\ncustomers utilize services, which could affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when we expect to recognize\nsuch as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24\nmonths with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue\ncurrently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original\nexpected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.\nDeferred Revenues\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance,\nincluding amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other.\nTotal deferred revenue as of December 31, 2022 was $4.5 billion, of which $2.1 billion was recognized as revenues\nduring the six months ended June 30, 2023.\n12"

The fair value of non-marketable equity securities that\nhave been remeasured due to impairment are classified within Level 3.\nAs of June 30, 2023 the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $29.1 billion, of which $1.5\nbillion were remeasured at fair value during the three months ended June 30, 2023 and primarily classified as Level\n3.\n14"

Variable Interest Entities (VIE)\nConsolidated VIEs\nWe consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of\noperations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.\nFor certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us and their creditors do not have recourse to\nus. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs\nwere $4.1 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs\nwere $2.6 billion for both periods. We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs that are included\nwithin Other Bets.\nTotal noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were $3.8 billion and $3.6 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023, respectively, of which $1.1 billion is redeemable noncontrolling interest\n(RNCI) for both periods. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to\nnoncontrolling interests was not material for any period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of\nOI&E. See Note 6 for further details on OI&E.\nUnconsolidated VIEs\nWe have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private\ncompanies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve\npower generation using renewable sources.\nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that\nwould significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results\nof operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We\naccount for these investments as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments.\nThe maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the\ninvestments and any future funding commitments. We have determined that the single source of our exposure to\nthese VIEs is our capital investments in them. The carrying value and maximum exposure of these unconsolidated\nVIEs were $2.7 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2022 and $3.0 billion and $3.0 billion,\nrespectively, as of June 30, 2023.\nNote 5. Debt\nShort-Term Debt\nWe have a debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net\nproceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as\nof December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023.\nOur short-term debt balance also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt.\n21"

We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could\naffect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible\nlosses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.\nCertain outstanding matters seek speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts, substantial\nchanges to our business practices and products, or structural remedies. Significant judgment is required to\ndetermine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and\nwe may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses.

The EC decision imposed a fine\nof \u20ac1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners'\nagreements, which we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed the EC decision, which\nremains pending. We recognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019.\nFrom time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on various competition\nmatters by regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally. For example:\n\u2022 In August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)\nrequesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our\nbusiness. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the\nDistrict of Columbia on October 20, 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search\nand Search advertising, and a trial is scheduled for September 2023. Further, in June 2022, the Australian\nCompetition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the United Kingdom's Competition and Markets\nAuthority (CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\n\u2022 On December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state\ndeceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology. Additionally, on January 24, 2023, the DOJ, along\nwith a number of state Attorneys General, filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for the\nEastern District of Virginia alleging that Google\u2019s digital advertising technology products violate U.S.\nantitrust laws, and on April 17, 2023, a number of additional state Attorneys General joined the complaint.\nThe EC, the CMA, and the ACCC each opened a formal investigation into Google's advertising technology\nbusiness practices on June 22, 2021, May 25, 2022, and June 29, 2022, respectively.

            "text": "Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\nthe EC issued a Statement of Objections (SO) informing Google of its preliminary view that Google violated\nEuropean antitrust laws relating to its advertising technology. We will respond to the SO by December 31,\n2023.\n\u2022 On July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court\nfor the Northern District of California, alleging that Google\u2019s operation of Android and Google Play violated\nU.S. antitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In May 2022, the EC and the CMA\neach opened investigations into Google Play\u2019s business practices. Korean regulators are investigating\nGoogle Play's billing practices, most recently opening a formal review in May 2022 of Google's compliance\nwith the new app store billing regulations.\nWe believe these complaints are without merit and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue to cooperate\nwith federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in\nthese lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or\norders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have\nto change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss\nof revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has\nincreasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC\naction can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important\nmarket, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing\nmany important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against\ncertain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such\nclaims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In\naddition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a\nresult of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\nOther\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent\norders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and\nemployment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or\npublishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, we currently\nhave a number of privacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. We also periodically have\ndata incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. Such claims, lawsuits, regulatory and\ngovernment investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders could result in substantial fines and penalties,\ninjunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to\nour business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of\nwhich could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, civil judgments that include compounding\npenalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including\nthose of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.\nNon-Income Taxes\nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters.\nThe subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied\nto the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We\naccrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax\nauthorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and\nthe loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity\nand uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially\ndifferent from our expectations.\nFor information regarding income tax contingencies, see Note 13.\n28"

Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales\nof apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products such as\nYouTube Premium and YouTube TV.\n\u2022 Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for\nenterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues from fees received for Google Cloud Platform\nservices, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\n\u2022 Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues\nfrom Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\nRevenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering\nactivities, and hardware, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the\nintegrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are\nmanaged centrally at a consolidated level. These costs, including the associated depreciation and impairment, are\nallocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage, headcount, or revenue.\nReflecting DeepMind's increasing collaboration with Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets,\nbeginning in the first quarter of 2023 DeepMind is reported as part of Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs instead\nof within Other Bets. Additionally, beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we updated and simplified our cost allocation\nmethodologies to provide our business leaders with increased transparency for decision-making. Prior periods have\nbeen recast to conform to the current presentation.\nAs announced on April 20, 2023, we brought together part of Google Research (the Brain team) and DeepMind\nto significantly accelerate our progress in artificial intelligence (AI). The group, called Google DeepMind, is reported\nwithin Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs prospectively beginning in the second quarter of 2023. Previously, the\nBrain team was included within Google Services.\nCertain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs\nprimarily include AI-focused shared R&D activities; corporate initiatives such as our philanthropic activities;\ncorporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and legal costs, including certain fines and\nsettlements. Charges associated with reductions in our workforce and office space announced in January 2023 are\nnot allocated to our segments. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are not allocated to our\nsegments.\nOur operating segments are not evaluated using asset information.\n31"

We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP\npercentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for\nfinancial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe\nthe presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to\nunderstand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of\nour core operating results.\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant\nperiod over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency\nexchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated\nlevel. We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a\nyear-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior\nyear comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.\nConstant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period\nrevenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are\ntranslated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of\nboth periods.\nThese results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with\nGAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled\nmeasures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\n40"

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in\nAugust 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc.\n(\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that\nprovide enterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration\ntools; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app\npurchases, and devices.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated\nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUnaudited Interim Financial Information\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal\nrecurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of\nthe results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2024. We have made estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual\nresults could differ materially from these estimates.\nThese consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update\n(ASU) 2023-07 \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\" which expands\nannual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about\nsignificant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2024, and for\ninterim periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential\neffect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 \"Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures\" to expand the disclosure requirements for income taxes. Upon adoption we will be required to disclose\nstandardized categories in the rate reconciliation in both percentage and dollar amounts. ASU 2023-09 will also\nrequire income taxes paid to be disaggregated by jurisdiction, among other disclosure requirements. We will adopt\nASU 2023-09 for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2025.\nPrior Period Reclassifications\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.\n11"

Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services\nthat have not yet been recognized as revenue. The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue recognition for\nthese commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when\nour customers utilize services. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over\nthe next 24 months with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred\nrevenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with\nan original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.\nDeferred Revenues\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance,\nincluding amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google\nsubscriptions, platforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2023 was $5.0 billion, of which\n$2.9 billion was recognized as revenues during the six months ended June 30, 2024.\nNote 3.

The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities\nthat have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or\nLevel 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment\nare classified within Level 3. Our valuation methods include option pricing models, market comparable approach,\nand common stock equivalent method, which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the\ntransaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, expected time to exit, risk free rate, and the\nrights, and obligations of the securities we hold. These inputs significantly vary based on investment type.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $31.6 billion, of which $2.2\nbillion were remeasured at fair value during the three months ended June 30, 2024 and classified within Level 2 and\nLevel 3 of the fair value hierarchy at the time of measurement.\n14"

The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and\nthe amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect was\n$300 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.\nFair Value Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our\nmarketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in\nthe assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OI&E, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the\nrelated hedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize\nchanges in the excluded component in OI&E.\nNet Investment Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks\nrelated to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of\nhedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude\nforward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in\nOI&E.\nOther Derivatives\nWe enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to\nhedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the\nfunctional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting\nhedges are primarily recorded in OI&E along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and\nliabilities.\nWe also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates,\ncommodity prices, and credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns. From time to time, we enter into\nderivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains and losses arising\nfrom other derivatives are primarily reflected within the \u201cother\u201d component of OI&E. See Note 6 for further details.\n17"

Variable Interest Entities (VIE)\nConsolidated VIEs\nWe consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of\noperations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.\nFor certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us, and their creditors do not have recourse to\nus. As of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2024, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs\nwere $4.9 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs\nwere $2.5 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs that are\nincluded within Other Bets.\nIn July 2024, Alphabet committed to fund up to $5.0 billion for the ongoing operations of Waymo, a fully\nautonomous driving technology company and a consolidated VIE.\nTotal noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were $3.4 billion and $3.3 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and June 30, 2024, respectively, of which $1.1 billion is redeemable noncontrolling interest\n(RNCI) for both periods. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to\nnoncontrolling interests was not material for any period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of\nOI&E. See Note 6 for further details on OI&E.\nUnconsolidated VIEs\nWe have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private\ncompanies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve\npower generation using renewable sources.\nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that\nwould significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results\nof operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We\naccount for these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments.\nThe maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the\ninvestments and any future funding commitments. The maximum exposure and carrying value of these\nunconsolidated VIEs were $5.7 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2023 and $6.9 billion and\n$5.4 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2024. The difference between the maximum exposure and the carrying\nvalue relates primarily to future funding commitments.\nNote 5. Debt\nShort-Term Debt\nWe have a debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net\nproceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as\nof December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2024.\nOur short-term debt balance also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt.\n21"

Commitments and Contingencies\nCommitments\nWe have content licensing agreements with future fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments of $9.7 billion as\nof June 30, 2024, of which the majority is paid quarterly through the first quarter of 2030.\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate\nactivities, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network partners, distribution partners,\ncustomers of Google Cloud offerings, lessors, and service providers with respect to certain matters. We have\nagreed to defend and/or hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or\ncovenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these\nagreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In\naddition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain\nsimilar indemnification obligations to our agents.\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification\nagreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the\npayments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the\nfuture, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations or cash flows in a particular period.\nAs of June 30, 2024, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably\npossible.\nLegal Matters\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be\nreasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be\nestimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could\naffect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible\nlosses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.\nCertain outstanding matters seek speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts, substantial\nchanges to our business practices and products, or structural remedies. Significant judgment is required to\ndetermine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and\nwe may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of outstanding legal\nmatters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either individually or in\naggregate, have a material adverse effect.\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\nAntitrust Matters\nOn November 30, 2010, the EC's Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various\nantitrust-related complaints against us.\n\u2022 On June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display\nand ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision\nimposed a \u20ac2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC\ndecision to the General Court, and on September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring\nshopping ads into compliance with the EC's decision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion for the fine in\nthe second quarter of 2017. On November 10, 2021, the General Court rejected our appeal, and we\nsubsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice on January 20, 2022.\n\u2022 On July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google\u2019s Android-related\ndistribution agreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a \u20ac4.3 billion ($5.1\nbillion as of June 30, 2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018,\nwe appealed the EC decision, and on October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android\ndistribution practices. On September 14, 2022, the General Court reduced the fine from \u20ac4.3 billion to\n\u20ac4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice. In 2018, we recognized a\ncharge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in 2022.\n25"

On June 4, 2019, we appealed\nthe EC decision. We recognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019.\nIn addition, on July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Northern District of California, alleging that Google\u2019s operation of Android and Google Play violated\nU.S. antitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In September 2023, we reached a settlement\nin principle with 50 state Attorneys General and three territories. The U.S. District Court subsequently vacated the\ntrial date with the states, and we expect any final approval of the settlement would come in 2024. In May 2024, we\nfunded the settlement amount to an escrow agent.\nIn December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict in a similar lawsuit in Epic Games v. Google. The jury\nfound that Google violated antitrust laws related to Google Play's business. Epic did not seek monetary damages.\nThe presiding judge will determine non-monetary remedies in 2024, and the range of potential remedies vary widely.\nWe plan to appeal.\nFrom time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on various competition\nmatters by regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally. Examples, for which given their\nnature we cannot estimate a possible loss include:\n\u2022 In August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)\nrequesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our\nbusiness. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the\nDistrict of Columbia on October 20, 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search\nand Search advertising. The trial ended on November 16, 2023, and we expect a decision in 2024. Further,\nin June 2022, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the United Kingdom's\nCompetition and Markets Authority (CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\n\u2022 On December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state\ndeceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology, and a trial is scheduled for March 2025.\nAdditionally, on January 24, 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state Attorneys General, filed an\nantitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging that Google\u2019s digital\nadvertising technology products violate U.S. antitrust laws, and on April 17, 2023, a number of additional\nstate Attorneys General joined the complaint. A trial is scheduled for September 2024. The EC, the CMA,\nand the ACCC each opened a formal investigation into Google's advertising technology business practices\non June 22, 2021, May 25, 2022, and June 29, 2022, respectively. On June 14, 2023, the EC issued a\nStatement of Objections (SO) informing Google of its preliminary view that Google violated European\nantitrust laws relating to its advertising technology. We responded to the SO on December 1, 2023.\n\u2022 In May 2022, the EC and the CMA each opened investigations into Google Play\u2019s business practices.\nKorean regulators are investigating Google Play's billing practices, including a formal review in May 2022 of\nGoogle's compliance with the new app store billing regulations.\nWe believe we have strong arguments against these claims and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue\nto cooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\nPrivacy Matters\nWe are subject to a number of privacy-related laws and regulations, and we currently are party to a number of\nprivacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. For example, there are ongoing investigations\nand litigation in the U.S. and the European Union, including those relating to our collection and use of location\ninformation, the choices we offer users, and advertising practices, which could result in significant fines, judgments,\nand product changes.\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in\nthese lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or\norders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have\nto change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss\n26"

In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has\nincreasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC\naction can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important\nmarket, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing\nmany important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against\ncertain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such\nclaims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In\naddition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a\nresult of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\nOther\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent\norders involving competition, intellectual property, data security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment,\ncommercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using\nour platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, we periodically have data\nincidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. Such claims, consent orders, lawsuits, regulatory\nand government investigations, and other proceedings could result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive\nrelief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our\nbusiness models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which\ncould harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, civil judgments that include compounding\npenalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including\nthose of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.\nNon-Income Taxes\nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters.\nThe subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied\nto the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We\naccrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax\nauthorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and\nthe loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity\nand uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially\ndifferent from our expectations.\nSee Note 12 for information regarding income tax contingencies.\nNote 9.

Certain of our costs\nand expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components\nof our operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue.\nAdditionally, fluctuations in compensation expenses may not directly correlate with changes in headcount, in\nparticular due to annual SBC awards that generally vest over four years.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues.\n\u2022 TAC includes:\n\u25e6 amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and\nservices. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment\nmanufacturers, and software developers; and\n\u25e6 amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n\u2022 Other cost of revenues primarily includes:\n\u25e6 compensation expense related to our technical infrastructure and other operations such as content\nreview and customer and product support;\n\u25e6 content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video\nand other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content\nproviders based on revenues generated or a flat fee);\n\u25e6 depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure;\n\u25e6 inventory and other costs related to the devices we sell; and\n\u25e6 other technical infrastructure operations costs, including bandwidth, energy, and equipment costs.\nTAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly\nhigher than TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search & other properties,\nbecause most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our\nGoogle Network partners.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as\neither R&D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative.\nThe main components of our R&D expenses are:\n\u2022 compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&D related to our\nexisting and new products and services;\n\u2022 depreciation; and\n\u2022 third-party services fees primarily relating to consulting and outsourced services in support of our\nengineering and product development efforts.\nThe main components of our sales and marketing expenses are:\n\u2022 compensation expenses for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain\ncustomer service functions; and\n\u2022 spending relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services.\nThe main components of our general and administrative expenses are:\n\u2022 compensation expenses for employees in finance, human resources, information technology, legal, and\nother administrative support functions;\n\u2022 expenses relating to legal matters, including certain fines and settlements; and\n\u2022 third-party services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and other outsourced administrative\nservices.\n35"

We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP\npercentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for\nfinancial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe\nthe presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to\nunderstand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of\nour core operating results.\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant\nperiod over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency\nexchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated\nlevel. We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a\nyear-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior\nyear comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.\nConstant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period\nrevenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are\ntranslated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of\nboth periods.\nThese results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with\nGAAP.

In Google Services, we also generate cash\nthrough consumer subscriptions, the sale of apps and in-app purchases, and devices. In Google Cloud, we\ngenerate cash through consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, collaboration tools,\nand other cloud services.\nOur primary uses of cash from operating activities include payments to distribution and Google Network\npartners, to employees for compensation, and to content providers. Other uses of cash from operating activities\ninclude payments to suppliers for devices, to tax authorities for income taxes, and other general corporate\nexpenditures.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased from the six months ended June 30, 2023 to the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2024 due to an increase in cash received from customers, partially offset by an increase in\ntax payments. The increase in tax payments in comparison to the prior year comparable period was primarily due to\nthe 2023 IRS payment deferral relief made available to taxpayers headquartered in designated counties in\nCalifornia.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nCash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of investments in marketable\nand non-marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of marketable and\nnon-marketable securities, purchases of property and equipment, and payments for acquisitions.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased from the six months ended June 30, 2023 to the six months\nended June 30, 2024 primarily due to an increase in maturities and sales of marketable securities, partially offset by\nincreases in purchases of property and equipment and purchases of marketable securities.\nCash Used in Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from\nthe sale of interests in consolidated entities. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of\nstock, net payments related to stock-based award activities, and repayments of debt.\nNet cash used in financing activities increased from the six months ended June 30, 2023 to the six months\nended June 30, 2024 due to dividend payments, increases in repurchases of stock, and net payments related to\nstock-based award activities.\nLiquidity and Material Cash Requirements\nWe expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, and cash flows from operations\nand financing activities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for\ninvesting and financing activities for at least the next 12 months, and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\n44"

The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend\nfrom months to years. For example, our data center construction projects are generally multi-year projects with\nmultiple phases, where we acquire land and buildings, construct buildings, and secure and install information\ntechnology assets.\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2024, we spent $13.2 billion and $25.2 billion on capital\nexpenditures, respectively. We expect to increase, relative to 2023, our investment in our technical infrastructure,\nincluding servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term\ninitiatives, in particular in support of AI products and services.

As of June 30, 2024, the amount of total future lease payments under operating\nleases, which had a weighted average remaining lease term of 7.9 years, was $16.9 billion.\nAs of June 30, 2024, we have entered into leases that have not yet commenced with future lease payments of\n$5.2 billion, that are not yet recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These leases will commence between\n2024 and 2027 with non-cancelable lease terms of one to 25 years.\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2024, our operating lease expenses (including variable lease\ncosts) were $2.2 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. Finance lease costs were not material for the six months\nended June 30, 2023 and 2024.\nFinancing\nWe have a short-term debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper.\nNet proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of June 30, 2024, we had no\ncommercial paper outstanding.\nAs of June 30, 2024, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, $4.0 billion expiring in April 2025 and\n$6.0 billion expiring in April 2028.The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using\ncertain market rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals.

RISK FACTORS\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described in\nPart I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as\nupdated in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, which could adversely affect\nour business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our stock. Below are\nmaterial changes to our risk factors since our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising. Reduced spending by advertisers,\na loss of partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to\ncustomize ads could harm our business.\nWe generated more than 75% of total revenues from online advertising in 2023. Many of our advertisers,\ncompanies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their\ncontracts with us at any time. These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more\nvalue (such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more\neffective monetization) than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy\npractices, such as our initiatives related to third-party cookies, including our recent announcement to move from\nphasing out all third-party cookies to a proposed user choice model (which remains subject to continuing\ndiscussions with regulators), as well as changes to other companies\u2019 advertising and/or data privacy practices have\nin the past, and may in the future, affect the advertising that we are able to provide. In addition, technologies have\nbeen developed that make customized ads more difficult, or that block the display of ads altogether, and some\nproviders of online services have integrated technologies that could potentially impair the availability and\nfunctionality of third-party digital advertising. Failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively\nand competitively could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions. Adverse\nmacroeconomic conditions have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in\nfluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and\noperating results.\nITEM 2.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in\nAugust 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc.\n(\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that\nprovide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure, platform services, and applications; sales of other\nproducts and services, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and\ndevices.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated\nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUnaudited Interim Financial Information\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal\nrecurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of\nthe results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2025. We have made estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual\nresults could differ materially from these estimates.\nThese consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 filed with the SEC.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update\n(ASU) 2023-09 \"Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\" to expand the disclosure\nrequirements for income taxes. Upon adoption, we will be required to disclose additional specified categories in the\nrate reconciliation in both percentage and dollar amounts. We will also be required to disclose the amount of income\ntaxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction, among other disclosure requirements. The standard, which is effective for\nour 2025 annual period, can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively and we are currently assessing which\nmethod to adopt.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03 \"Income Statement: Reporting Comprehensive Income-\nExpense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40)\" to improve the disclosures about an entity\u2019s expenses.\nUpon adoption, we will be required to disclose in the notes to the financial statements a disaggregation of certain\nexpense categories included within the expense captions on the face of the income statement. The standard is\neffective for our 2027 annual period, and our interim periods beginning in 2028, with early adoption permitted. The\nstandard can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We are currently assessing adoption timing and the\neffect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\nPrior Period Reclassifications\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.\n12"

Revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that\nhave not yet been recognized as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately 55% of the revenue backlog as\nrevenues over the next 24 months with the remainder to be recognized thereafter. The estimated revenue backlog\nand timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with\nrelevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services. Revenue backlog includes related deferred\nrevenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with\nan original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.\nDeferred Revenues\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance,\nincluding amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google\nsubscriptions, platforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2024 was $6.0 billion, of which\n$3.5 billion was recognized as revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2025. Total deferred revenue as of\nJune 30, 2025 was $6.8 billion.\nNote 3.

These inputs vary significantly based on investment type.\nAs of June 30, 2025, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $49.8 billion, of which $3.2\nbillion was remeasured at fair value during the three months ended June 30, 2025 and was primarily classified\nwithin Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy at the time of measurement.\n15"

The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and\nthe amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.\nAs of June 30, 2025, the net accumulated loss on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect was\n$767 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.\nFair Value Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our\nmarketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in\nthe assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OI&E, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the\nrelated hedged items.

Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in\nAOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. For derivative instruments, we exclude forward points\nand time value from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in\nOI&E.\nWe had no foreign currency-denominated debt as of December 31, 2024 and $7.8 billion carrying value of\nforeign currency-denominated debt designated as net investment hedges as of June 30, 2025.\nOther Derivatives\nWe enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to\nhedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the\nfunctional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting\nhedges are primarily recorded in OI&E along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and\nliabilities.\nWe also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates,\ncommodity prices, and credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns. From time to time, we enter into\nderivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities.

The results of\noperations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.\nFor certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us, and their creditors do not have recourse to\nus. As of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs\nwere $8.7 billion and $7.0 billion, respectively, and are primarily included in cash and cash equivalents on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025, liabilities for which creditors only have\nrecourse to the VIEs were $2.3 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing operations of\ncertain VIEs that are included within Other Bets.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025, total noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated\nsubsidiaries were $4.2 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, of which $1.1 billion was redeemable noncontrolling\ninterests (RNCI) in each period. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to\nnoncontrolling interests was not material for any period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of\nOI&E. See Note 7 for further details on OI&E.\nUnconsolidated VIEs\nWe have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private\ncompanies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve\npower generation using renewable sources.\nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that\nwould significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results\nof operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We\naccount for these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments, which\nare included within non-marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The maximum exposure of\nthese unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the investments and any future\nfunding commitments. As of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025, our future funding commitments related to\nunconsolidated VIE investments were $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.\nNote 6. Debt\nShort-Term Debt\nWe have a short-term debt financing program of up to $25.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper.\nNet proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had $2.3 billion and $3.0 billion of\ncommercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025, respectively, with a weighted-average\neffective interest rate of 4.4% in each period. The estimated fair value of the commercial paper approximated its\ncarrying value as of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025.\nOur short-term debt balance also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt.\nLong-Term Debt\nIn May 2025, we issued $5.0 billion of U.S. dollar-denominated fixed-rate senior unsecured notes in four\ntranches: $750 million of 4.00% notes due 2030, $1.25 billion of 4.50% notes due 2035, $1.5 billion of 5.25% notes\ndue 2055, and $1.5 billion of 5.30% notes due 2065. Additionally in May 2025, we issued \u20ac6.75 billion of euro-\ndenominated fixed-rate senior unsecured notes in five tranches: \u20ac1.5 billion of 2.50% notes due 2029, \u20ac1.5 billion of\n3.00% notes due 2033, \u20ac1.25 billion of 3.38% notes due 2037, \u20ac1.25 billion of 3.88% notes due 2045, and\n\u20ac1.25 billion of 4.00% notes due 2054.

We have\nagreed to defend and/or indemnify certain parties against losses arising from a breach of representations or\ncovenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these\nagreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In\naddition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain\nsimilar indemnification obligations to our agents.\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification\nagreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the\npayments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the\nfuture, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations or cash flows in a particular period.\nAs of June 30, 2025, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably\npossible.\nLegal Matters\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be\nreasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be\nestimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could\naffect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible\nlosses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.\nCertain outstanding matters seek speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts, substantial\nchanges to our business practices and products, or structural remedies. Significant judgment is required to\ndetermine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and\nwe may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of outstanding legal\nmatters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either individually or in\naggregate, have a material adverse effect.\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\nAntitrust Matters\nWe are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations as well as litigation on various competition\nmatters by regulatory authorities and private parties in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally, including\nthe following:\n\u2022 Shopping: In June 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google relating to its\ndisplay and ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European antitrust laws and imposed a\n\u20ac2.4 billion fine. In 2024, we made a cash payment of $3.0 billion for the fine.\n28"

            "text": "\u2022 Android: In July 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google\u2019s Android-related\ndistribution agreements infringed European antitrust laws, imposed a \u20ac4.3 billion fine, and directed the\ntermination of the conduct at issue. We appealed the EC decision and implemented changes to certain of\nour Android distribution practices. In September 2022, the General Court affirmed the EC decision but\nreduced the fine from \u20ac4.3 billion to \u20ac4.1 billion. We subsequently appealed the General Court's affirmation\nof the EC decision with the European Court of Justice, which remains pending. In 2018, we recognized a\ncharge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in 2022.\n\u2022 AdSense for Search: In March 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google's\nagreements with AdSense for Search partners infringed European antitrust laws, imposed a fine of \u20ac1.5\nbillion, and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners' agreements, which we implemented\nprior to the decision. In 2019, we recognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine and appealed the EC\ndecision. In September 2024, the General Court overturned the EC decision and annulled the \u20ac1.5 billion\nfine. The EC has appealed the General Court's decision with the European Court of Justice.\n\u2022 Search: In October 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and a number of state Attorneys General\nfiled a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that Google violated U.S.\nantitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising. In August 2024, the U.S. District Court for the\nDistrict of Columbia ruled that Google violated such U.S. antitrust laws. A separate proceeding to determine\nremedies, the range of which vary widely, concluded in May 2025. The DOJ's remedy proposal included\nalterations to our products and services and our business models and operations, including structural\nremedies, and our distribution arrangements, among other changes, some of which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business. We expect a decision on remedies in August 2025, after which we intend to\nappeal the August 2024 ruling and, potentially, aspects of the remedies decision following our review of that\ndecision.\nFurther, in June 2022, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and in October 2023, the\nJapanese Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\nIn April 2025, the JFTC issued a cease-and-desist order requiring us to make changes to our Android\nagreements to ensure they are consistent with Japanese antitrust law. The JFTC did not impose monetary\npenalties. We are constructively engaging with JFTC regarding compliance with the order.\nGiven the nature of these matters, we cannot estimate a possible loss.\n\u2022 Advertising Technology: In December 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as\nstate deceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology. A trial will take place after a decision on\nremedies is issued in the following DOJ case against Google relating to its advertising technology. In\nJanuary 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state Attorneys General, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to its\nadvertising technology, and a number of additional state Attorneys General subsequently joined the lawsuit.\nIn April 2025, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia issued a mixed decision in the DOJ\ncase against Google, ruling that the DOJ failed to show that Google\u2019s advertiser tools or acquisitions of\nDoubleClick and AdMeld were anticompetitive, but that Google\u2019s publisher tools violated antitrust laws by\nexcluding rivals. A separate proceeding to determine remedies, the range of which vary widely, is scheduled\nto take place in September 2025. The DOJ's remedy proposal includes structural remedies, which could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business. We also filed a remedy proposal ahead of the September\nproceedings. After a decision on remedies, we plan to appeal the adverse portion of the April 2025 decision\nand, potentially, aspects of the remedies decision following our review of that decision.\nFurther, in June 2023, the EC issued a Statement of Objections informing Google of its preliminary view that\nGoogle violated European antitrust laws relating to its advertising technology, to which we responded. In\nSeptember 2024, the UK also issued a Statement of Objections on similar grounds, to which we responded.\nGiven the nature of these matters, we cannot estimate a possible loss.\n\u2022 Google Play: In July 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for\nthe Northern District of California alleging that Google\u2019s operation of Android and Google Play violated U.S.\nantitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In September 2023, we reached a\nsettlement in principle with 50 state Attorneys General and three territories and recognized a charge. Final\napproval of the settlement remains pending before the court. In May 2024, we funded the settlement\namount to an escrow agent.\n29"

            "text": "In December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict in Epic Games v. Google finding that Google\nviolated U.S. antitrust laws related to Google Play's business. Epic did not seek monetary damages. The\npresiding judge issued a remedies decision in October 2024, ordering a variety of alterations to our\nbusiness models and operations and contractual agreements for Android and Google Play. We are\nappealing the verdict and the trial court judge temporarily paused the implementation of the remedies while\nthe Court of Appeals considers our request to pause implementation of the remedies pending the duration\nof the appeal. Given the nature of this matter, we cannot estimate a possible loss.\n\u2022 European Digital Markets Act: In March 2024, the EC opened two investigations regarding Google's\ncompliance with certain provisions of the European Union's (EU) Digital Markets Act relating to Google Play\nand Search. In March 2025, the EC issued preliminary findings of non-compliance in both investigations, to\nwhich we responded. Given the nature of this matter, we cannot estimate a possible loss.\nIn addition to these antitrust proceedings, private individual and collective actions that overlap with claims\npursued by regulatory authorities are pending in the U.S. and in several other jurisdictions, including across Europe.\nGiven the nature of these matters, we cannot estimate a possible loss.\nWe believe we have strong arguments against these open claims and will defend ourselves vigorously. We\ncontinue to cooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\nPrivacy Matters\nWe are subject to a number of privacy-related laws and regulations, and we currently are party to a number of\nprivacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. For example, there are ongoing investigations\nand litigation in the U.S. and the EU, including those relating to our collection and use of location information,\nalleged violations of state biometric statutes, the choices we offer users, and advertising practices, which could\nresult in significant fines, judgments, and product changes. In April 2025, we reached a $1.4 billion agreement in\nprinciple to settle certain privacy matters.\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in\nthese lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or\norders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have\nto change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss\nof revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has\nincreasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC\naction can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important\nmarket, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing\nmany important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\nFurther, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a\nresult of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\nOther\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and investigations, other proceedings,\nand consent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related\ncompliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services\noffered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, AI training, and other\nmatters. For example, we periodically have data incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law.\nSuch claims, consent orders, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings could\nresult in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to\nour products and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or\nother adverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating\nresults.\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, some matters concern civil judgments that\ninclude compounding penalties imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts,\nincluding those of sanctioned parties. We do not expect these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse\neffect.\nNon-Income Taxes\n30"

We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP\npercentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for\nfinancial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe\nthe presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to\nunderstand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of\nour core operating results.\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant\nperiod over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency\nexchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated\nlevel. We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a\nyear-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior\nyear comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.\nConstant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period\nrevenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are\ntranslated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of\nboth periods.\nThese results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with\nGAAP.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in\nAugust 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc.\n(\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that\nprovide customers with infrastructure and platform services and collaboration tools; sales of other products and\nservices, such as apps and in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and fees received for\nsubscription-based products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated\nunder the variable interest and voting models. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUnaudited Interim Financial Information\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal\nrecurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of\nthe results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2022. We have made estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual\nresults could differ materially from these estimates.\nThese consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 filed with the SEC.\nStock Split Effected in the Form of a Stock Dividend (\u201cStock Split\u201d)\nOn February 1, 2022, the company announced that the Board of Directors had approved and declared a 20-\nfor-one stock split in the form of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the company\u2019s Class A, Class\nB, and Class C stock. The Stock Split had a record date of July 1, 2022 and an effective date of July 15, 2022. The\npar value per share of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock remains unchanged at $0.001 per share after the\nStock Split. All prior period references made to share or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated\nfinancial statements and applicable disclosures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock\nSplit.\n11"

Our revenue backlog represents commitments in\ncustomer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenues. The amount and timing of\nrevenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by when our customers utilize services and our ability\nto deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms, which could affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when\nwe expect to recognize such as revenues. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded\nas well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods and excludes contracts with an original expected term of\none year or less and cancellable contracts.\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance,\nincluding amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other.\nTotal deferred revenue as of December 31, 2021 was $3.8 billion, of which $2.4 billion was recognized as revenues\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2022.\nNote 3. Financial Instruments\nDebt Securities\nWe classify our marketable debt securities, which are accounted for as available-for-sale, within Level 2 in the\nfair value hierarchy because we use quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and\nmodels utilizing market observable inputs to determine fair value.\n12"

The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the measurement\nalternative). Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured during the period based on observable\ntransactions are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the value based\non valuation methods which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date\nand other unobservable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. The fair value of\nnon-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment are classified within Level 3.\nGains and losses on marketable and non-marketable equity securities\nGains and losses (including impairments) reflected in other income (expense), net, for marketable and non-\nmarketable equity securities are summarized below (in millions):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2021 2022 2021 2022\nNet gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period $ (36) $ (73) $ 545 $ (355)\nNet unrealized gain (loss) on equity securities held as of\nthe end of the period 2,157 (574) 9,185 (1,613)\nTotal gain (loss) recognized in other income\n(expense), net $ 2,121 $ (647) $ 9,730 $ (1,968)\nIn the table above, net gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period reflects the difference between the\nsale proceeds and the carrying value of the equity securities at the beginning of the period or the purchase date, if\nlater.\n14"

Further, we enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for\ncollateral to be received or pledged when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from\ncontractually established thresholds. Cash collateral received related to derivative instruments under our collateral\nsecurity arrangements are included in other current assets with a corresponding liability. Cash and non-cash\ncollateral pledged related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements are included in other\ncurrent assets.\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge\ncertain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have\nmaturities of 24 months or less.\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and\nsubsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude the change in\nforward points and time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness. The initial value of the excluded\ncomponent is amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument and recognized in revenues.\nThe difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to revenues is\nrecorded in AOCI.

Fair value hedge amounts included in the\nassessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net, along with the offsetting gains\nand losses of the related hedged items. We exclude changes in forward points from the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in other income (expense), net.\nNet Investment Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks\nrelated to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of\nhedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude\nchanges in forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded\ncomponent in other income (expense), net.\nOther Derivatives\nOther derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist primarily of foreign currency forward contracts\nthat we use to hedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies\nother than the functional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these contracts, as well as the related costs,\nare recognized in other income (expense), net, along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets\nand liabilities.\nWe also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates,\ncommodity prices, credit exposures and to enhance investment returns.

Contingencies\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate\nactivities, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network partners, customers of Google Cloud\nofferings, lessors, and service providers with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to hold certain parties\nharmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property\ninfringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which\nan indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification\nagreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification\nagreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, we have\na limited history of prior indemnification claims and the payments we have made under such agreements have not\nhad a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent\nthat valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or\nreasonably possible.\nLegal Matters\nAntitrust Investigations\nOn November 30, 2010, the EC's Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various\nantitrust-related complaints against us.\nOn June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display\nand ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a\n\u20ac2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision to the\nGeneral Court, and on September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into\ncompliance with the EC's decision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2017.\nOn November 10, 2021, the General Court rejected our appeal, and we subsequently filed an appeal with the\nEuropean Court of Justice on January 20, 2022.\nOn July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google\u2019s Android-related distribution\nagreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a \u20ac4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30,\n2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision,\nand on October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution practices. On September\n14, 2022, the General Court rejected our appeal on three claims, accepted our appeal on one claim, and reduced\nthe fine to \u20ac4.1 billion. We are preparing to appeal to the European Court of Justice. In the second quarter of 2018,\nwe recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in the third quarter of 2022.\nOn March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that\nGoogle had with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a fine\nof \u20ac1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners'\nagreements, which we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed the EC decision, which\nremains pending. We recognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019.\nWhile each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities\non our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines.\nFrom time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on various competition\nmatters by regulatory authorities in the United States (U.S.), Europe, and other jurisdictions globally. For example:\n\u2022 In August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)\nrequesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our\nbusiness. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit on October 20, 2020 alleging\nthat Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising. Further, in June 2022,\nthe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the United Kingdom's Competition and\nMarkets Authority (CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\n\u2022 On December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state\n27"

The EC, the CMA, and the ACCC each opened a formal investigation into Google's advertising\ntechnology business practices on June 22, 2021, May 25, 2022, and June 29, 2022, respectively.\n\u2022 On July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court\nfor the Northern District of California, alleging that Google\u2019s operation of Android and Google Play violated\nU.S. antitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In May 2022, the EC and the CMA\neach opened a formal investigation into Google Play\u2019s business practices. Korean regulators are\ninvestigating Google Play's billing practices, most recently opening a formal review in May 2022 of Google's\ncompliance with the new app store billing regulations.\nWe believe these complaints are without merit and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue to cooperate\nwith federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in\nthese lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or\norders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have\nto change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss\nof revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has\nincreasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC\naction can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important\nmarket, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing\nmany important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against\ncertain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such\nclaims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In\naddition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a\nresult of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\nOther\nWe are also regularly subject to claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings,\nand consent decrees involving competition, intellectual property, privacy and cybersecurity, tax and related\ncompliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services\noffered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters.\nFor example, we currently have a number of privacy investigations and suits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. Such\nclaims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent decrees could result in\nsubstantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing auditing and monitoring obligations, changes to our\nproducts and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or\nother adverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating\nresults.\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, civil judgments that include compounding\npenalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including\nthose of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect on\nour business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nCertain outstanding matters include speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts. We record a\nliability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably\nestimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we\ndisclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount\nof liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and\nmake adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being\nand the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters.\nWith respect to our outstanding matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range\nof reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of such\nmatters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.\n28"

Additionally, our non-advertising revenues,\nincluding those generated from Google Cloud, Google Play, hardware, and YouTube, may be affected by\nfluctuations driven by changes in pricing, digital content releases, fee structures, new product and service launches,\nand other market dynamics, as well as seasonality.\nRevenues and Monetization Metrics\nGoogle Services\nGoogle Services revenues consist of revenues generated from advertising (\u201cGoogle advertising\u201d) as well as\nrevenues from other sources (\u201cGoogle other revenues\u201d).\nGoogle Advertising\nGoogle advertising revenues are comprised of the following:\n\u2022 Google Search & other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including\nrevenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search\nin browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and\nGoogle Play;\n\u2022 YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and\n\u2022 Google Network, which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob,\nAdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\nWe use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our\nadvertising revenues: paid clicks and cost-per-click pertain to traffic on Google Search & other properties, while\nimpressions and cost-per-impressions pertain to traffic on our Network partners\u2019 properties.\nPaid clicks represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users on Google\nsearch properties and other Google owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google\nPlay. Cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the\naverage amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.\nImpressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in\nAdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based\nrevenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for\neach impression displayed to users.\nAs our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring,\ngathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues\ngenerated by the corresponding click and impression activity.\nOur advertising revenue growth, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search &\nother properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties and the\ncorrelation between these items, have been affected and may continue to be affected by various factors, including:\n\u2022 advertiser competition for keywords;\n34"

Our operating expenses\ninclude costs related to R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of these\nexpenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our\noperating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to the changes in revenue.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues.\n\u2022 TAC includes:\n\u25e6 Amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and\nservices. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment\nmanufacturers, and software developers.\n\u25e6 Amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n\u2022 Other cost of revenues includes:\n\u25e6 Content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video\nand other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content\nproviders based on revenues generated or a flat fee).\n35"

We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps\nimprove the ability to understand our performance because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that\nare not indicative of our core operating results.\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant\nperiod over period. We define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the effect of foreign\nexchange rate movements and hedging activities, and use it to determine the constant currency revenue\npercentage change on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current\nperiod revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects\nrealized in the current period.\nConstant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period\nrevenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are\ntranslated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of\nboth periods.\nThese results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with\nGAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled\nmeasures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\n40"

Below are material changes to our risk factors since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021.\nA variety of new and existing laws and/or interpretations could harm our business.\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters.\nNew laws and regulations, or new interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a manner\ninconsistent with our practices, have made, and may continue to make, our products and services less useful, limit\nour ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products and services in certain jurisdictions, require us\nto incur substantial costs, expose us to civil or criminal liability, or cause us to change our business practices. These\nlaws and regulations are evolving and involve matters central to our business, including, among others:\n\u2022 Laws and regulations around the world focused on large technology platforms, including the Digital Markets\nAct in the European Union and proposed antitrust legislation on self-preferencing and mergers and\nacquisitions in the U.S., which may limit certain business practices, and in some cases, create the risk of\nsignificant penalties.\n\u2022 Privacy laws, such as the GDPR, CCPA, CPRA, Virginia CDPA, and ColoPA (as defined and discussed\nfurther below).\n\u2022 Data protection laws passed by many states within the U.S. and by certain countries regarding notification\nto data subjects and/or regulators when there is a security breach of personal data.\n\u2022 Consumer protection laws, including EU\u2019s New Deal for Consumers, which could result in monetary\npenalties and create a range of new compliance obligations.\n\u2022 New laws further restricting the collection, processing and/or sharing of advertising-related data. Copyright\nor similar laws around the world, including the EU Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market\n(EUCD) and EU member state transpositions. These and similar laws that have been adopted or proposed\nintroduce new licensing regimes that could affect our ability to operate. The EUCD and similar laws could\nalso increase the liability of some content-sharing services with respect to content uploaded by their users.\nSome of these laws, as well as follow-on administrative or judicial actions, have also created or may create\na new property right in news publications that limits the ability of some online services to link to, interact\nwith, or present such content. They may also require individual or collective compensation negotiations with\nnews agencies and publishers for the use of such content, which may result in payment obligations that\nsignificantly exceed the value that such content provides to Google and its users, potentially harming our\nservices, commercial operations, and business results.\n\u2022 Data localization laws, which generally mandate that certain types of data collected in a particular country\nbe stored and/or processed within that country.\n\u2022 Various U.S. and international laws that govern the distribution of certain materials to children and regulate\nthe ability of online services to collect information from minors, including the Children\u2019s Online Privacy\nProtection Act of 1998 and the United Kingdom\u2019s Age-Appropriate Design Code.\n\u2022 Various laws with regard to content moderation and removal, and related disclosure obligations, such as\nGermany's Network Enforcement Act, the European Union's Digital Services Act, Florida's Senate Bill 7072\nand Texas' House Bill 20, which may affect our businesses and operations and may subject us to significant\nlitigation, damage claims, and fines if they are interpreted and applied in a manner inconsistent with our\npractices and policies, or if we remove or promote (or fail to remove or promote) content in ways\ninconsistent with those laws. Other countries, including Singapore, Australia, and the United Kingdom, have\nimplemented or are considering similar legislation imposing penalties for failure to remove certain types of\ncontent.\n49"

There are legislative proposals and pending litigation in both the U.S. (such as Gonzalez v.\nGoogle) and EU that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for websites and online platforms.\n\u2022 Court decisions such as the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on May 13,\n2014 on the \u2018right to be forgotten,\u2019 which allows individuals to demand that Google remove search results\nabout them in certain instances, may limit the content we can show to our users and impose significant\noperational burdens.\nThe introduction of new businesses, products, services, and technologies, our activities in certain jurisdictions,\nor other actions we take have subjected us, and will likely continue to subject us, to additional laws and regulations.\nOur investment in a variety of new fields, such as healthcare and payment services, has expanded, and will\ncontinue to expand, the scope of regulations that apply to our business. The costs of compliance with these laws\nand regulations are high and are likely to increase in the future. Any failure on our part to comply with laws and\nregulations can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and may subject us to\nsignificant liabilities and other penalties.\nITEM 2.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in\nAugust 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc.\n(\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that\nprovide enterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration\ntools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received\nfor subscription-based products.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated\nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUnaudited Interim Financial Information\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal\nrecurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of\nthe results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2023. We have made estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual\nresults could differ materially from these estimates.\nThese consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the SEC.\nChange in Accounting Estimate\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and\nadjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain\nnetwork equipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal\nyear 2023. Based on the carrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December 31, 2022, and\nthose placed in service during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the effect of this change in estimate\nwas a reduction in depreciation expense of $977 million and $2.9 billion and an increase in net income of $761\nmillion and $2.3 billion, or $0.06 and $0.18 per basic and $0.06 and $0.18 per diluted share, for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nPrior Period Reclassifications\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.\n11"

Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future\nservices that have not yet been recognized as revenue. The amount and timing of revenue recognition for these\ncommitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our\ncustomers utilize services, which could affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when we expect to recognize\nsuch as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24\nmonths with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue\ncurrently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original\nexpected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.\nDeferred Revenues\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance,\nincluding amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other.\nTotal deferred revenue as of December 31, 2022 was $4.5 billion, of which $2.3 billion was recognized as revenues\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n12"

We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance\ninvestment returns.\nWe recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the\nderivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize\nchanges in the excluded component in OI&E.\nNet Investment Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks\nrelated to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of\nhedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude\nforward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in\nOI&E.\nOther Derivatives\nWe enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to\nhedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the\nfunctional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting\nhedges are primarily recorded in OI&E along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and\nliabilities.\nWe also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates,\ncommodity prices, credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns. From time to time, we enter into derivatives\nto hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains and losses arising from other\nderivatives are primarily reflected within the \u201cother\u201d component of OI&E. See Note 6 for further details.\n17"

Variable Interest Entities (VIE)\nConsolidated VIEs\nWe consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of\noperations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.\nFor certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us and their creditors do not have recourse to\nus. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these\nVIEs were $4.1 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the\nVIEs were $2.6 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs\nthat are included within Other Bets.\nTotal noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were $3.8 billion and $3.4 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023, respectively, of which $1.1 billion is redeemable noncontrolling\ninterest (RNCI) for both periods. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to\nnoncontrolling interests was not material for any period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of\nOI&E. See Note 6 for further details on OI&E.\nUnconsolidated VIEs\nWe have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private\ncompanies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve\npower generation using renewable sources.\nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that\nwould significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results\nof operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We\naccount for these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments.\nThe maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the\ninvestments and any future funding commitments. The maximum exposure and carrying value of these\nunconsolidated VIEs were $2.8 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2022 and $5.5 billion and\n$3.8 billion, respectively, as of September 30, 2023. The difference between the maximum exposure and the\ncarrying value relates primarily to future funding commitments.\nNote 5. Debt\nShort-Term Debt\nWe have a debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net\nproceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as\nof December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023.\nOur short-term debt balance also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt.\n21"

The outcomes of outstanding legal\nmatters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either individually or in\naggregate, have a material adverse effect.\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\nAntitrust Investigations\nOn November 30, 2010, the EC's Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various\nantitrust-related complaints against us.\nOn June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display\nand ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a\n\u20ac2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision to the\nGeneral Court, and on September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into\ncompliance with the EC's decision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2017.\nOn November 10, 2021, the General Court rejected our appeal, and we subsequently filed an appeal with the\nEuropean Court of Justice on January 20, 2022.\nOn July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google\u2019s Android-related distribution\nagreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a \u20ac4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30,\n2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision,\nand on October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution practices. On September\n14, 2022, the General Court reduced the fine from \u20ac4.3 billion to \u20ac4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal with\nthe European Court of Justice. In 2018, we recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by\n$217 million in 2022.\nOn March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that\nGoogle had with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a fine\nof \u20ac1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners'\nagreements, which we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed the EC decision. We\nrecognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019.\nFrom time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on various competition\nmatters by regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally. For example:\n\u2022 In August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)\nrequesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our\nbusiness. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the\nDistrict of Columbia on October 20, 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search\nand Search advertising. The trial commenced on September 12, 2023, and we expect a decision in 2024.\nFurther, in June 2022, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the United\nKingdom's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution\npractices.\n\u2022 On December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state\ndeceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology. Additionally, on January 24, 2023, the DOJ, along\nwith a number of state Attorneys General, filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for the\nEastern District of Virginia alleging that Google\u2019s digital advertising technology products violate U.S.\nantitrust laws, and on April 17, 2023, a number of additional state Attorneys General joined the complaint.\nThe EC, the CMA, and the ACCC each opened a formal investigation into Google's advertising technology\n27"

On June 14, 2023,\nthe EC issued a Statement of Objections (SO) informing Google of its preliminary view that Google violated\nEuropean antitrust laws relating to its advertising technology. We will respond to the SO by December 31,\n2023.\n\u2022 On July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court\nfor the Northern District of California, alleging that Google\u2019s operation of Android and Google Play violated\nU.S. antitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In September 2023, we reached a\nsettlement in principle with 50 state Attorneys General and three territories. The U.S. District Court\nsubsequently vacated the trial date with the states, and any final approval of the settlement is expected to\noccur in 2024. In May 2022, the EC and the CMA each opened investigations into Google Play\u2019s business\npractices. Korean regulators are investigating Google Play's billing practices, including a formal review in\nMay 2022 of Google's compliance with the new app store billing regulations. On October 6, 2023, the Korea\nCommunications Commission issued a preliminary decision that we are not in full compliance with the new\nregulations. We intend to respond in November 2023.\nWe believe these complaints are without merit and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue to cooperate\nwith federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in\nthese lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or\norders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have\nto change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss\nof revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has\nincreasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC\naction can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important\nmarket, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing\nmany important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against\ncertain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such\nclaims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In\naddition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a\nresult of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\nOther\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent\norders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and\nemployment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or\npublishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, we currently\nhave a number of privacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. We also periodically have\ndata incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. Such claims, lawsuits, regulatory and\ngovernment investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders could result in substantial fines and penalties,\ninjunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to\nour business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of\nwhich could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, civil judgments that include compounding\npenalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including\nthose of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.\nNon-Income Taxes\nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters.\nThe subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied\nto the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We\naccrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax\nauthorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and\nthe loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity\n28"

Information about Segments and Geographic Areas\nWe report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:\n\u2022 Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Google Maps,\nGoogle Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales\nof apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products such as\nYouTube Premium and YouTube TV.\n\u2022 Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for\nenterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues from fees received for Google Cloud Platform\nservices, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\n\u2022 Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues\nfrom Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\nRevenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering\nactivities, and hardware, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the\nintegrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are\nmanaged centrally at a consolidated level. These costs, including the associated depreciation and impairment, are\nallocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage, headcount, or revenue.\nReflecting DeepMind's increasing collaboration with Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets,\nbeginning in the first quarter of 2023 DeepMind is reported as part of Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs instead\nof within Other Bets. Additionally, beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we updated and simplified our cost allocation\nmethodologies to provide our business leaders with increased transparency for decision-making. Prior periods have\nbeen recast to conform to the current presentation.\nAs announced on April 20, 2023, we brought together part of Google Research (the Brain team) and DeepMind\nto significantly accelerate our progress in artificial intelligence (AI). The group, called Google DeepMind, is reported\nwithin Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs prospectively beginning in the second quarter of 2023. Previously, the\nBrain team was included within Google Services.\nCertain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs\nprimarily include AI-focused shared R&D activities; corporate initiatives such as our philanthropic activities;\ncorporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and legal costs, including certain fines and\nsettlements. Charges associated with reductions in our workforce and office space announced in January 2023 are\nnot allocated to our segments. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are not allocated to our\nsegments.\nOur operating segments are not evaluated using asset information.\n32"

We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP\npercentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for\nfinancial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe\nthe presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to\nunderstand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of\nour core operating results.\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant\nperiod over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency\nexchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated\nlevel. We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a\nyear-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior\nyear comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.\nConstant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period\nrevenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are\ntranslated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of\nboth periods.\nThese results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with\nGAAP.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in\nAugust 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc.\n(\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that\nprovide enterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration\ntools; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app\npurchases, and devices.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated\nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUnaudited Interim Financial Information\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal\nrecurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of\nthe results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2024. We have made estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual\nresults could differ materially from these estimates.\nThese consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update\n(ASU) 2023-07 \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\" which expands\nannual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about\nsignificant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2024, and for\ninterim periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential\neffect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 \"Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures\" to expand the disclosure requirements for income taxes. Upon adoption we will be required to disclose\nstandardized categories in the rate reconciliation in both percentage and dollar amounts. ASU 2023-09 will also\nrequire income taxes paid to be disaggregated by jurisdiction, among other disclosure requirements. We will adopt\nASU 2023-09 for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2025.\nPrior Period Reclassifications\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.\n11"

Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future\nservices that have not yet been recognized as revenue. The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue\nrecognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract\nterms and when our customers utilize services. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog\nas revenues over the next 24 months with the remainder to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes\nrelated deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes\ncontracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.\nDeferred Revenues\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance,\nincluding amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google\nsubscriptions, platforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2023 was $5.0 billion, of which\n$3.4 billion was recognized as revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nNote 3.

The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities\nthat have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or\nLevel 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment\nare classified within Level 3. Our valuation methods include option pricing models, market comparable approach,\nand common stock equivalent method, which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the\ntransaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, expected time to exit, risk free rate, and the\nrights, and obligations of the securities we hold. These inputs significantly vary based on investment type.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $33.7 billion, of\nwhich $13.7 billion were remeasured at fair value during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and were\nprimarily classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy at the time of measurement.\n14"

We present our collar contracts (an option strategy\ncomprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at\ngross fair values. The accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation.\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge\ncertain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States (U.S.) dollar. These\ncontracts have maturities of 24 months or less.\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and\nsubsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points\nand time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life\nof the hedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and\nthe amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the net accumulated loss on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax\neffect was $433 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.\nFair Value Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our\nmarketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in\nthe assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OI&E, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the\nrelated hedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize\nchanges in the excluded component in OI&E.\nNet Investment Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks\nrelated to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of\nhedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude\nforward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in\nOI&E.\nOther Derivatives\nWe enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to\nhedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the\nfunctional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting\nhedges are primarily recorded in OI&E along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and\nliabilities.\n17"

The results of\noperations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.\nFor certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us, and their creditors do not have recourse to\nus. As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these\nVIEs were $4.9 billion and $7.8 billion, respectively and are primarily included in cash and cash equivalents on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, liabilities for which creditors only\nhave recourse to the VIEs were $2.5 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing\noperations of certain VIEs that are included within Other Bets.\nWaymo, a fully autonomous driving technology company and a consolidated VIE, received $4.8 billion in\nfunding during the three months ended September 30, 2024, followed by an additional $860 million in October 2024.\nThe majority of the total funding of $5.6 billion was provided by Alphabet. Investments from external parties were\naccounted for as equity transactions and resulted in recognition of noncontrolling interests.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, total noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated\nsubsidiaries were $3.4 billion, of which $1.1 billion was redeemable noncontrolling interests (RNCI) for both periods.\nNCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was not\nmaterial for any period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of OI&E. See Note 6 for further\ndetails on OI&E.\nUnconsolidated VIEs\nWe have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private\ncompanies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve\npower generation using renewable sources.\nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that\nwould significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results\nof operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We\naccount for these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments, which\nare included within non-marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The maximum exposure of\nthese unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the investments and any future\nfunding commitments. As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, our future funding commitments related\nto unconsolidated VIE investments were $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively.\nNote 5. Debt\nShort-Term Debt\nWe have a debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net\nproceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as\nof December 31, 2023 and $1.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted-average effective interest\nrate of 4.8% as of September 30, 2024. The estimated fair value of the commercial paper approximated its carrying\nvalue as of September 30, 2024.\n21"

We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could\naffect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible\nlosses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.\nCertain outstanding matters seek speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts, substantial\nchanges to our business practices and products, or structural remedies.

The EC decision\nimposed a \u20ac2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine. We appealed the EC decision and\nimplemented product changes to bring shopping ads into compliance with the EC's decision. On September\n10, 2024, the European Court of Justice rejected our appeal and upheld the \u20ac2.4 billion fine imposed in\n2017. In the third quarter of 2024, we made a cash payment of $3.0 billion for the 2017 shopping fine.\n\u2022 On July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google\u2019s Android-related\ndistribution agreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a \u20ac4.3 billion ($5.1\nbillion as of June 30, 2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018,\nwe appealed the EC decision, and on October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android\ndistribution practices. On September 14, 2022, the General Court reduced the fine from \u20ac4.3 billion to\n\u20ac4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice. In 2018, we recognized a\ncharge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in 2022.\n\u2022 On March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that\nGoogle had with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision\nimposed a fine of \u20ac1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for\nSearch partners' agreements, which we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed\nthe EC decision. We recognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019. On\nSeptember 18, 2024, the European Union\u2019s (EU) General Court overturned the EC decision and annulled\nthe \u20ac1.5 billion fine. The EC has until November 28, 2024 to appeal the decision.\nIn addition, on July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Northern District of California, alleging that Google\u2019s operation of Android and Google Play violated\nU.S. antitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In September 2023, we reached a settlement\nin principle with 50 state Attorneys General and three territories. The U.S. District Court subsequently vacated the\ntrial date with the states, and we expect any final approval of the settlement would come in 2024. In May 2024, we\nfunded the settlement amount to an escrow agent.\nIn December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict in a similar lawsuit in Epic Games v. Google. The jury\nfound that Google violated antitrust laws related to Google Play's business. Epic did not seek monetary damages.\nThe presiding judge issued a remedies decision on October 7, 2024, ordering a variety of alterations to our business\nmodels and operations and contractual agreements for Android and Google Play. We are appealing and have filed a\nmotion to pause the implementation of some of the remedies pending the appeal. The trial court judge has\ntemporarily paused the implementation of the remedies while the Court of Appeals considers our request to pause\nimplementation of the remedies pending the duration of the appeal.\nFrom time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on various competition\nmatters by regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally. Examples, for which given their\nnature we cannot estimate a possible loss include:\n\u2022 In August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)\nrequesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our\nbusiness. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the\nDistrict of Columbia on October 20, 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search\nand Search advertising. The trial ended on November 16, 2023, and on August 5, 2024, the U.S. District\nCourt for the District of Columbia ruled that Google violated such antitrust laws. A separate proceeding is\nbeing held to determine remedies, the range of which vary widely. The DOJ has proposed a high level\nremedy framework, which includes alterations to our products and services and our business models and\noperations, including structural remedies, and/or our distribution arrangements, among other changes,\nsome of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements. Further, in June 2022, the\nAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the United Kingdom's Competition and\nMarkets Authority (CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\n26"

            "text": "\u2022 On December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state\ndeceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology, and a trial is scheduled for March 2025.\nAdditionally, on January 24, 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state Attorneys General, filed an\nantitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging that Google\u2019s digital\nadvertising technology products violate U.S. antitrust laws, and on April 17, 2023, a number of additional\nstate Attorneys General joined the complaint. The trial ended on September 27, 2024, and we expect a\ndecision in late 2024 or early 2025. The EC, the CMA, and the ACCC each opened a formal investigation\ninto Google's advertising technology business practices on June 22, 2021, May 25, 2022, and June 29,\n2022, respectively. On June 14, 2023, the EC issued a Statement of Objections (SO) informing Google of its\npreliminary view that Google violated European antitrust laws relating to its advertising technology. We\nresponded to the SO on December 1, 2023. On September 6, 2024, the CMA issued an SO informing\nGoogle of its preliminary view that Google violated UK competition laws relating to its advertising\ntechnology. We will respond to the SO.\n\u2022 In May 2022, the EC and the CMA each opened investigations into Google Play\u2019s business practices. The\nEC closed its initial investigation, but is now investigating Google Play\u2019s compliance with certain provisions\nof EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act. Korean regulators are investigating Google Play's billing practices, including a\nformal review in May 2022 of Google's compliance with the new app store billing regulations.\nWe believe we have strong arguments against these claims and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue\nto cooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\nPrivacy Matters\nWe are subject to a number of privacy-related laws and regulations, and we currently are party to a number of\nprivacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. For example, there are ongoing investigations\nand litigation in the U.S. and the EU, including those relating to our collection and use of location information, the\nchoices we offer users, and advertising practices, which could result in significant fines, judgments, and product\nchanges.\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in\nthese lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or\norders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have\nto change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss\nof revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has\nincreasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC\naction can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important\nmarket, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing\nmany important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against\ncertain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such\nclaims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In\naddition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a\nresult of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\nOther\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent\norders involving competition, intellectual property, data security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment,\ncommercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using\nour platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, we periodically have data\nincidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. Such claims, consent orders, lawsuits, regulatory\nand government investigations, and other proceedings could result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive\nrelief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our\nbusiness models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which\ncould harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\n27"

We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP\npercentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for\nfinancial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe\nthe presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to\nunderstand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of\nour core operating results.\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant\nperiod over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency\nexchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated\nlevel. We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a\nyear-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior\nyear comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.\nConstant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period\nrevenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are\ntranslated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of\nboth periods.\nThese results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with\nGAAP.

This increase was primarily due to a cumulative one-time adjustment recorded for tax rule\nchanges issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the third quarter of 2023. Additionally, a decrease in the\nU.S. federal Foreign Derived Intangible Income tax deduction in 2024 contributed to the higher effective tax rate.\nThe effective tax rate increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024. This increase was primarily due to a one-time adjustment for tax rule changes issued by the\nIRS in the third quarter of 2023. Additionally, a decrease in the 2024 U.S. federal Foreign Derived Intangible Income\ntax deduction contributed to an increase in the effective tax rate.

Some countries have already implemented the legislation effective January 1, 2024, and we expect\nothers to follow, however we do not expect a material change to our income tax provision for the 2024 fiscal year. As\nadditional jurisdictions enact such legislation, transitional rules lapse, and other provisions of the minimum tax\nlegislation become effective, we expect our effective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase in future years.\nFinancial Condition\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had $93.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable\nsecurities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly\nliquid government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, and marketable\nequity securities.\nSources, Uses of Cash and Related Trends\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash\nflow that we generate from operations. The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long-term growth\nof the business.

Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of marketable and\nnon-marketable securities, purchases of property and equipment, and payments for acquisitions and purchases of\nintangible assets.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to an increase in purchases of property and equipment and\npurchases of marketable securities, partially offset by increases in maturities and sales of marketable securities.\nCash Used in Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from\nthe sale of interests in consolidated entities. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of\nstock, net payments related to stock-based award activities, payment of dividends, and repayments of debt.\nNet cash used in financing activities increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 due to dividend payments and net payments related to stock-based award\nactivities.\nLiquidity and Material Cash Requirements\nWe expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, and cash flows from operations\nand financing activities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for\ninvesting and financing activities for at least the next 12 months, and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\nCapital Expenditures and Leases\nWe make investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology assets\nthrough purchases of property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our\nservices and products.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories:\n\u2022 technical infrastructure, which consists of our investments in servers and network equipment for computing,\nstorage, and networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including AI, (collectively referred to\nas our information technology assets) and data center land and building construction; and\n\u2022 office facilities, ground-up development projects, and building improvements (also referred to as \"fit-outs\").\nConstruction in progress consists primarily of technical infrastructure and office facilities which have not yet\nbeen placed in service. The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend\nfrom months to years. For example, our data center construction projects are generally multi-year projects with\nmultiple phases, where we acquire land and buildings, construct buildings, and secure and install information\ntechnology assets.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, we spent $21.2 billion and $38.3 billion on\ncapital expenditures, respectively. We expect to increase, relative to 2023, our investment in our technical\ninfrastructure, including servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and\nour long-term initiatives, in particular in support of AI products and services.

The Court is holding a separate proceeding to determine\nremedies, which could include alterations to our products and services and our business models and operations,\nincluding structural remedies, and/or our distribution arrangements, among other changes. While we plan to appeal,\nthere can be no assurance that our appeal will succeed, or that we will be able to change or decrease the severity\nof any remedies that may be ordered, and any or all of these potential remedies could harm our business,\nreputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nAlso, in December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict in Epic Games v. Google finding that Google\nviolated antitrust laws related to Google Play's business. The presiding judge issued a remedies decision on\nOctober 7, 2024 that ordered a variety of alterations to our business models and operations and contractual\nagreements for Android and Google Play. We are appealing and have filed a motion to pause the implementation of\nsome of the remedies pending the appeal, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our appeal or\nin our efforts to pause the implementation of the remedies pending the appeal.

We are cooperating with these investigations and defending\nlitigation or appealing decisions where appropriate.\nWe are also subject to a variety of claims including product warranty, product liability, and consumer protection\nclaims related to product defects, among other litigation, and we may also be subject to claims involving health and\nsafety, hazardous materials usage, other environmental effects, AI training, development, and commercialization, or\nservice disruptions or failures. Claims have been brought, and we expect will continue to be brought, against us for\ndefamation, negligence, breaches of contract, patent, copyright and trademark infringement, unfair competition,\nunlawful activity, torts, privacy rights violations, fraud, or other legal theories based on the nature and content of\ninformation available on or via our services, the design and effect of our products and services, or due to our\ninvolvement in hosting, transmitting, marketing, branding, or providing access to content created by third parties.\n49"
