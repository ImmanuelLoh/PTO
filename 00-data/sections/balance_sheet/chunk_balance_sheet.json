Cost is computed using the first-in, first-out method. Variable Interest Entities We determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in which we have other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity (VIE). We consolidate VIEs when we are the primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have the power to direct activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses or benefits. If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP. Periodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination of whether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary. Property and Equipment Property and equipment includes the following categories: land and buildings, information technology assets, construction in progress, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures. Land and buildings include land, offices, data centers, and related building improvements. Information technology assets include servers and network equipment. Construction in progress is the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service. We account for property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which we regularly evaluate. Land is not depreciated. We depreciate buildings over periods of seven to 25 years. We depreciate information technology assets generally over periods of four to five years (generally, four years for servers and five years for network equipment). We depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation for buildings, information technology assets, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures commences once they are ready for our intended use. Leases We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non- lease components. Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed. Non-lease components primarily include payments for maintenance and utilities. We combine fixed payments for non-lease components with lease payments and account for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets and liabilities. Certain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the lease assets and liabilities. These amounts include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index, payments contingent on wind or solar production for power purchase arrangements, and payments for maintenance and utilities. Lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is",

Variable Interest Entities Consolidated VIEs We consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary.

For certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us and their creditors do not have recourse to us. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $6.0 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs were $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively.

Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We account for these investments as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments. The maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the investments and any future funding commitments.

We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have the power to direct activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses or benefits. If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP. Periodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination of whether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary. Property and Equipment Property and equipment is comprised of technical infrastructure, office space, corporate and other assets currently in service, and assets not yet in service. Technical infrastructure includes data center land, buildings and leasehold improvements, and servers and network equipment. Office space includes office land, buildings and leasehold improvements. Assets not yet in service are those that are not ready for our intended use, including data center buildings and servers in the process of construction or assembly. Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation commences once assets are ready for our intended use and is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which we regularly evaluate for factors such as technological obsolescence and our planned use and utilization. We depreciate data center and office buildings over periods of seven to 40 years. We depreciate servers and network equipment generally over a period of six years. We depreciate corporate and other assets over periods of two to 25 years. We depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Land is not depreciated. Goodwill We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units periodically, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in reporting units, we reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. We test our goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Goodwill impairments were not material for the periods presented. Leases We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non- lease components. Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed. Non-lease components primarily include payments for maintenance and utilities. We combine fixed payments for non-lease components with lease payments and account for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets and liabilities. Certain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the lease assets and liabilities. These amounts primarily include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index, and payments for maintenance and utilities. Lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease",

Our lease terms include periods under options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.

For certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us, and their creditors do not have recourse to us. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $4.9 billion and $8.7 billion, respectively and are primarily included in cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs were $2.5 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs that are included within Other Bets. Waymo, a fully autonomous driving technology company and a consolidated VIE, received $5.6 billion in funding during the year ended December 31, 2024, the majority of which was funded by Alphabet. Investments from external parties were accounted for as equity transactions and resulted in recognition of noncontrolling interests. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, total noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were $3.4 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, of which $1.1 billion was redeemable noncontrolling interests (RNCI) for both periods. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was not material for any period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of OI&E. See Note 7 for further details on OI&E. Unconsolidated VIEs We have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private companies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve power generation using renewable sources. We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We account for these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments, which are included within non-marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the investments and any future funding commitments. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, our future funding commitments related to unconsolidated VIE investments were $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. Note 6.

The results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements. For certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us and their creditors do not have recourse to us. As of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2022, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $6.0 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs were $2.5 billion for both periods. As of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2022, total noncontrolling interests (NCI), including redeemable noncontrolling interests (RNCI), in our consolidated subsidiaries was $4.3 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was not material for any period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of other income (expense), net. See Note 6 for further details on other income (expense), net. Unconsolidated VIEs We have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private companies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve power generation using renewable sources. We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We account for these investments as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments. The maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the investments and any future funding commitments. We have determined that the single source of our exposure to these VIEs is our capital investments in them. The carrying value and maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs were $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2021 and $2.4 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2022.

        "text": "Capital Expenditures and Leases We make investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology assets through purchases of property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our services and products. Capital Expenditures Our capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories: \u2022 technical infrastructure, which consists of our investments in servers and network equipment for computing, storage, and networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including AI, (collectively referred to as our information technology assets) and data center land and building construction; and \u2022 office facilities, ground-up development projects, and building improvements (also referred to as \"fit-outs\"). Construction in progress consists primarily of technical infrastructure and office facilities which have not yet been placed in service. The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend from months to years. For example, our data center construction projects are generally multi-year projects with multiple phases, where we acquire land and buildings, construct buildings, and secure and install information technology assets. During the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2024, we spent $13.2 billion and $25.2 billion on capital expenditures, respectively. We expect to increase, relative to 2023, our investment in our technical infrastructure, including servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term initiatives, in particular in support of AI products and services. Depreciation of our property and equipment commences when the deployment of such assets are completed and are ready for our intended use. Land is not depreciated. For the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2024, our depreciation on property and equipment was $5.5 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively. Leases For the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2024, we recognized total operating lease assets of $1.7 billion and $897 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2024, the amount of total future lease payments under operating leases, which had a weighted average remaining lease term of 7.9 years, was $16.9 billion. As of June 30, 2024, we have entered into leases that have not yet commenced with future lease payments of $5.2 billion, that are not yet recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These leases will commence between 2024 and 2027 with non-cancelable lease terms of one to 25 years. For the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2024, our operating lease expenses (including variable lease costs) were $2.2 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. Finance lease costs were not material for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2024. Financing We have a short-term debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of June 30, 2024, we had no commercial paper outstanding. As of June 30, 2024, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, $4.0 billion expiring in April 2025 and $6.0 billion expiring in April 2028.The interest",

The results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements. For certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us and their creditors do not have recourse to us. As of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $6.0 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs were $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, total noncontrolling interests (NCI), including redeemable noncontrolling interests (RNCI), in our consolidated subsidiaries were $4.3 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was not material for any period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of other income (expense), net. See Note 6 for further details on other income (expense), net. Unconsolidated VIEs We have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private companies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve power generation using renewable sources. We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We account for these investments as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments. The maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the investments and any future funding commitments. We have determined that the single source of our exposure to these VIEs is our capital investments in them. The carrying value and maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs were $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2021 and $2.6 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, as of September 30, 2022.

Capital Expenditures and Leases We make investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology assets through purchases of property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our services and products. Capital Expenditures Our capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories: \u2022 technical infrastructure, which consists of investments in servers and network equipment for computing, storage and networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including machine learning (collectively referred to as information technology assets) and data center land and building construction; and \u2022 office facilities, ground up development projects, and related building improvements. Construction in progress consists primarily of technical infrastructure and office facilities which have not yet been placed in service for our intended use. The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend from months to years. For example, our data center construction projects are generally multi- year projects with multiple phases, where we acquire qualified land and buildings, construct buildings, and secure and install information technology assets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2022, capital expenditures were $18.3 billion and $23.9 billion, respectively. Depreciation of our property and equipment commences when the deployment of such assets are completed and are ready for our intended use. Land is not depreciated. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2022, depreciation and impairment expenses on property and equipment were $8.3 billion and $11.2 billion, respectively. Leases For the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2022, we recognized total operating lease assets of $2.2 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2022, the amount of total future lease payments under operating leases, which had a weighted average remaining lease term of 9 years, was $16.8 billion. As of September 30, 2022, we have entered into leases that have not yet commenced with future lease payments of $4.1 billion, excluding purchase options, that are not yet recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These leases will commence between 2022 and 2026 with non-cancelable lease terms of 1 to 25 years. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2022, our operating lease expenses (including variable lease costs) were $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. Finance lease costs were not material for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2022. Financing We have a short-term debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2022, we had no commercial paper outstanding. As of September 30, 2022, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, $4.0 billion expiring in April 2023 and $6.0 billion expiring in April 2026.
