We also have long-term taxes payable of $6.6 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of June 30, 2023. As a result of the 2023 IRS payment deferral relief made available to taxpayers headquartered in designated counties in California, we are postponing our second and third quarter tax payments until the fourth quarter of 2023. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Purchase Commitments As of June 30, 2023, we had material contractual obligations of $42.0 billion, of which $27.9 billion was short- term. These amounts consist of purchase orders for certain technical infrastructure as well as the non-cancelable portion or the minimum cancellation fee in certain agreements related to commitments to purchase licenses, including content licenses, inventory and network capacity. For those agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of June 30, 2023. In certain instances, the amount of our contractual obligations may change based on the expected timing of order fulfillment from our suppliers. For more information related to our content licenses, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition we regularly enter into multi-year, non-cancellable agreements to purchase renewable energy and energy attributes, such as renewable energy certificates. These agreements do not include a minimum dollar commitment. The amounts to be paid under these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated and are not readily determinable.

European Commission Fines In 2017, 2018 and 2019, the EC announced decisions that certain actions taken by Google infringed European competition law and imposed fines of \u20ac2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017), \u20ac4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018), and \u20ac1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019), respectively. On September 14, 2022, the General Court rejected our appeal on three claims, accepted our appeal on one claim, and reduced the fine to \u20ac4.1 billion. We are preparing to appeal to the European Court of Justice. In the second quarter of 2018 we recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in the third quarter of 2022. While each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines. For further details, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Taxes As of September 30, 2022, we had short-term and long-term income taxes payable of $1.6 billion and $4.2 billion related to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\"). As permitted by the Tax Act, we will pay the transition tax in annual interest-free installments through 2025. We also have taxes payable of $4.4 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2022.
