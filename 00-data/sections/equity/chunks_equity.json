        "text": "Financial filing text section: Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\nIf an adverse 10% foreign currency exchange rate change was applied to total monetary assets, liabilities, and\ncommitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies at the balance sheet date, it would have\nresulted in an adverse effect on income before income taxes of approximately $285 million and $136 million as of\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively, after consideration of the effect of foreign exchange contracts in place for\nthe years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022.\nWe use foreign currency forward and option contracts, including collars (an option strategy comprised of a\ncombination of purchased and written options) to protect forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from changes in\nforeign currency exchange rates. When the U.S. dollar strengthens, gains from foreign currency forward and option\ncontacts reduce the foreign currency losses related to our earnings. When the U.S. dollar weakens, losses from foreign\ncurrency forward and option contracts offset the foreign currency gains related to our earnings. These hedging\ncontracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We designate\nthese contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. We reflect the gains or losses of foreign currency spot\nrate changes as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and subsequently reclassify them\ninto revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur.\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10% as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, the amount recorded in AOCI related to\nour cash flow hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $1.3 billion lower for both December 31, 2021\nand 2022. The change in the value recorded in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency\nchange in forecasted hedged revenues when recognized.\nWe use foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency\nrisks related to investment in foreign subsidiaries. These forward contracts serve to offset the foreign currency\ntranslation risk from our foreign operations.\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10%, the amount recorded in cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) within AOCI\nrelated to our net investment hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $975 million and $903 million\nlower as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. The change in value recorded in CTA would be expected to\noffset a corresponding foreign currency translation gain or loss from our investment in foreign subsidiaries.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur Corporate Treasury investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and\nmaintain liquidity. We invest primarily in debt securities, including government bonds, corporate debt securities,\nmortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, money market and other funds, time deposits, and interest rate\nderivatives. By policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and\nfloating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair\nmarket value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income\nthan predicted if interest rates fall. Unrealized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to\ninterest rate fluctuations as compared to interest rates at the time of purchase. For certain fixed and variable rate debt\nsecurities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in other income\n(expense), net. We measure securities for which we have not elected the fair value option at fair value with gains and\nlosses recorded in AOCI until the securities are sold, less any expected credit losses.\nWe use value-at-risk (VaR) analysis to determine the potential effect of fluctuations in interest rates on the value\nof our marketable debt security portfolio. The VaR is the expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, for\nour investment portfolio due to adverse movements in interest rates. We use a variance/covariance VaR model with\n95% confidence interval. The estimated one-day loss in fair value of marketable debt securities as of December 31,\n2021 and 2022 are shown below (in millions):\n12-Month Average\nAs of December 31, As of December 31,\n2021 2022 2021 2022\nRisk category - interest rate $ 139 $ 256 $ 148 $ 198\nActual future gains and losses associated with our marketable debt security portfolio may differ materially from the\nsensitivity analyses performed as of December 31, 2021 and 2022 due to the inherent limitations associated with\npredicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates and our actual exposures and positions. VaR analysis is\nnot intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation.\nEquity Investment Risk\nOur marketable and non-marketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that\ncould substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings.\n41",

(the Company) as of December 31,\n2021 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash\nflows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial\nstatement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). In\nour opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the\nCompany at December 31, 2021 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three\nyears in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control\u2014Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 2, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion\nthereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to\nthose risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in\nthe financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates\nmade by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our\naudits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion\non the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter\nbelow, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.\n44",

Financial Instruments\nFair Value Measurements\nInvestments measured at fair value on a recurring basis\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable equity securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 1\nand Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets or inputs\nthat are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets.\nDebt securities are classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted market prices to\nthe extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine fair\nvalue. For certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are\nrecorded in other income (expense), net.

While these net gains (losses) may have been reflected in periods prior to the period of sale, we\nbelieve they are important supplemental information as they reflect the economic net gains (losses) on the securities\nsold during the period.

Our share of gains and losses, including impairments, are included as a\ncomponent of other income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 7 for further details\non other income (expense), net.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe use derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk\nmanaged is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings,\nand investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We\nalso enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance investment returns.\nWe recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the derivatives\nprimarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy comprised of a\ncombination of purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at gross fair values.\nThe accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation.\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge\ncertain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have\nmaturities of 24 months or less.\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and\nsubsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points and\ntime value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life of the\nhedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the\namount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect\nwas $171 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.\nFair Value Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our\nmarketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in the\nassessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net, along with the offsetting gains and\nlosses of the related hedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and\nrecognize changes in the excluded component in other income (expense), net.\nNet Investment Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks\nrelated to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude forward\npoints from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in other income\n(expense), net.\nOther Derivatives\nWe enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to\nhedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the\nfunctional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting\nhedges are primarily recorded in other income (expense), net along with the foreign currency gains and losses on\nmonetary assets and liabilities.\nWe also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates,\ncommodity prices, credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns. From time to time, we enter into derivatives to\nhedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains and losses arising from other\nderivatives are primarily reflected within the \u201cother\u201d component of other income (expense), net. See Note 7 for further\ndetails.\n64",

BUSINESS\nOverview\nAs our founders Larry and Sergey wrote in the original founders' letter, \"Google is not a conventional company.\nWe do not intend to become one.\" That unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history, inspiring\nus to tackle big problems and invest in moonshots. It led us to be a pioneer in the development of AI and, since 2016,\nan AI-first company. We continue this work under the leadership of Alphabet and Google CEO, Sundar Pichai.\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses \u2014 the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments,\nGoogle Services and Google Cloud, and all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Alphabet's structure is\nabout helping each of our businesses prosper through strong leaders and independence.\nAccess and Technology for Everyone\nThe Internet is one of the world\u2019s most powerful equalizers; it propels ideas, people, and businesses large and\nsmall. Our mission to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant\ntoday as it was when we were founded in 1998. Since then, we have evolved from a company that helps people find\nanswers to a company that also helps people get things done.\nWe are focused on building an even more helpful Google for everyone, and we aspire to give everyone the tools\nthey need to increase their knowledge, health, happiness, and success. Google Search helps people find information\nand make sense of the world in more natural and intuitive ways, with trillions of searches on Google every year.\nYouTube provides people with entertainment, information, and opportunities to learn something new. Google Assistant\noffers the best way to get things done seamlessly across different devices, providing intelligent help throughout a\nperson's day, no matter where they are. Google Cloud helps customers solve today\u2019s business challenges, improve\nproductivity, reduce costs, and unlock new growth engines. We are continually innovating and building new products\nand features that will help our users, partners, customers, and communities and have invested more than $150 billion\nin research and development in the last five years in support of these efforts.\nMaking AI Helpful for Everyone\nAI is a transformational technology that can bring meaningful and positive change to people and societies across\nthe world, and for our business. At Google, we have been bringing AI into our products and services for more than a\ndecade and making them available to our users. Our journey began in 2001, when machine learning was first\nincorporated into Google Search to suggest better spellings to users searching the web. Today, AI in our products is\n4.",

AI has been used\nin Google Workspace for years to improve grammar, efficiency, security, and more with features like Smart\nReply, Smart Compose, and malware and phishing protection in Gmail. Duet AI in Google Workspace helps\nusers write, organize, visualize, accelerate workflows, and have richer meetings.\n\u2022 AI Platform and Duet AI for Google Cloud: Our Vertex AI platform gives developers the ability to train, tune,\naugment, and deploy applications using generative AI models and services such as Enterprise Search and\nConversations. Duet AI for Google Cloud provides pre-packaged AI agents that assist developers to write, test,\ndocument, and operate software.\nOther Bets\nAcross Alphabet, we are also using technology to try to solve big problems that affect a wide variety of industries\nfrom improving transportation and health technology to exploring solutions to address climate change. Alphabet\u2019s\ninvestment in the portfolio of Other Bets includes businesses that are at various stages of development, ranging from\nthose in the R&D phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization. Our goal is for them to become\nthriving, successful businesses. Other Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own\nboards with independent members and outside investors. While these early-stage businesses naturally come with\nconsiderable uncertainty, some of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their\nindustries. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet\nservices.\nCompetition\nOur business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptive technologies. We face formidable\ncompetition in every aspect of our business, including, among others, from:\n\u2022 general purpose search engines and information services;\n\u2022 vertical search engines and e-commerce providers for queries related to travel, jobs, and health, which users\nmay navigate directly to rather than go through Google;\n\u2022 online advertising platforms and networks;\n\u2022 other forms of advertising, such as billboards, magazines, newspapers, radio, and television as our advertisers\ntypically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline;\n\u2022 digital content and application platform providers;\n\u2022 providers of enterprise cloud services;\n\u2022 developers and providers of AI products and services;\n\u2022 companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that\nhave developed proprietary platforms;\n\u2022 providers of digital video services;\n\u2022 social networks, which users may rely on for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information\nthrough traditional search engines;\n\u2022 providers of workspace communication and connectivity products; and\n\u2022 digital assistant providers.\nCompeting successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and\ntechnologies to the marketplace across our businesses. For example, for advertising, competing successfully depends\non attracting and retaining:\n\u2022 users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance\nof our advertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and availability of our products and services;\n\u2022 advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver\ntheir advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels; and\n\u2022 content providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners\ngenerate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\n8.",

In\nour opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the\nCompany at December 31, 2022 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three\nyears in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control\u2014Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated January 30, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion\nthereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to\nthose risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in\nthe financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates\nmade by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our\naudits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective or complex judgments.

Adjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date and are\nrecorded as a component of OI&E.\nNon-marketable securities that do not have effective contractual maturity dates are classified as other non-\ncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nSee Note 3 for the accounting policy pertaining to derivative financial instruments.\nAccounts Receivable\nOur payment terms for accounts receivable vary by the types and locations of our customers and the products or\nservices offered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or\nservices and customers, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer.\nAdditionally, accounts receivable includes amounts for services performed in advance of the right to invoice the\ncustomer.\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable, which is recorded as an offset to accounts\nreceivable, and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements\nof Income. We assess collectibility by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics\nexist and on an individual basis when we identify specific customers with known disputes or collectibility issues. In\ndetermining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we consider historical collectibility based on past due status\nand make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also consider\ncustomer-specific information, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic\nconditions.\nOther\nOur financial instruments also include debt and equity investments in companies with which we also entered into\ncommercial arrangements at or near the same time. For these transactions, judgment is required in assessing the\nsubstance of the arrangements, including assessing whether the components of the arrangements should be\naccounted for as separate transactions under the applicable GAAP, and determining the value of the components of\nthe arrangements, including the fair value of the investments. Additionally, if our investment in such companies\nbecomes impaired, any remaining performance obligations would be reassessed and may be reduced.\nImpairment of Investments\nWe periodically review our debt and non-marketable equity securities for impairment.\nFor debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists. The credit loss is\nestimated by considering available information relevant to the collectibility of the security and information about past\nevents, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Any credit loss is recorded as a charge to OI&E,\nnot to exceed the amount of the unrealized loss. Unrealized losses other than the credit loss are recognized in AOCI. If\nwe have an intent to sell, or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a debt security in an unrealized\nloss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis, we will write down the security to its fair value and record the\ncorresponding charge as a component of OI&E.\nFor non-marketable equity securities, including equity method investments, we consider whether impairment\nindicators exist by evaluating the companies' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among\nother indicators. If the assessment indicates that the investment is impaired, we write down the investment to its fair\nvalue by recording the corresponding charge as a component of OI&E. We prepare quantitative measurements of the\nfair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income approach.\nInventory\nInventory consists primarily of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is\ncomputed using the first-in, first-out method.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in\nwhich we have other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity (VIE). We consolidate VIEs when we are\nthe primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have the power to direct activities that most\nsignificantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses\n60.",

The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities\nthat have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or Level 3\nin the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the value based on valuation methods, including option pricing models,\nmarket comparable approach, and common stock equivalent method, which may include a combination of the\nobservable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, expected time to\nexit, risk free rate, and the rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. These inputs significantly vary based on\ninvestment type. The fair value of non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment are\nclassified within Level 3.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $28.8 billion, of which\n$13.7 billion were remeasured at fair value during the year ended December 31, 2023, and primarily classified within\nLevel 2 of the fair value hierarchy at the time of measurement.\n65.",

        "text": "Financial filing text section: Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\nNote 11. Stockholders' Equity\nClass A and Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock\nOur Board of Directors has authorized three classes of stock, Class A and Class B common stock, and Class C\ncapital stock. The rights of the holders of each class of our common and capital stock are identical, except with respect\nto voting. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock\nis entitled to 10 votes per share. Class C capital stock has no voting rights, except as required by applicable law.\nShares of Class B common stock may be converted at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically\nconvert upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock.\nShare Repurchases\nIn the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023, we repurchased $50.3 billion, $59.3 billion, and\n$62.2 billion, respectively, of Alphabet's Class A and Class C shares.\nIn April 2023, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional\n$70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares. As of December 31, 2023, $36.3 billion remains available for Class A\nand Class C share repurchases.\nThe following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 Year Ended December 31, 2023\nShares Amount Shares Amount\nClass A share repurchases 61 $ 6,719 78 $ 9,316\nClass C share repurchases 469 52,577 450 52,868\nTotal share repurchases(1) 530 $ 59,296 528 $ 62,184\n(1) Shares repurchased include unsettled repurchases as of December 31, 2023.\nClass A and Class C shares are repurchased in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its\nstockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading\nprices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. Repurchases are executed from time to time, subject to\ngeneral business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or\nprivately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an\nexpiration date.\nNote 12. Net Income Per Share\nWe compute net income per share of Class A, Class B, and Class C stock using the two-class method. Basic net\nincome per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net\nincome per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutive\nsecurities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of RSUs and other contingently issuable\nshares. The dilutive effect of outstanding RSUs and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings\nper share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A\nstock assumes the conversion of Class B stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B stock does not\nassume the conversion of those shares.\nThe rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock\nare identical, except with respect to voting. Furthermore, there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of\nincorporation, as well as Delaware law, which preclude our Board of Directors from declaring or paying unequal per\nshare dividends on our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. Specifically, Delaware law provides that amendments to\nour certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a\ngiven class of stock must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment. In\naddition, our certificate of incorporation provides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder vote, it\nmust be approved by the unanimous consent of our Board of Directors. As a result, the undistributed earnings for each\nyear are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A, Class B, and Class C stock as if the\nearnings for the year had been distributed. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed\nearnings are allocated on a proportionate basis.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023, the net income per share amounts are the same for\nClass A, Class B, and Class C stock because the holders of each class are entitled to equal per share dividends or\ndistributions in liquidation in accordance with the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Alphabet Inc.\n80.",

At Google, we have been bringing AI into our products and services for\nmore than a decade and making them available to our users.\nIn 2023, we took a significant step on our journey to make AI more helpful for everyone with the introduction of\nGemini, our natively multimodal AI model. In 2024, we launched Gemini 2.0, our most capable model yet. Gemini can\ngeneralize and seamlessly understand, operate across, and combine different types of information including text, code,\naudio, image, and video. Gemini is powering AI features across our products and services that are helping people\neveryday. Today, all seven of our two billion-user products \u2014 Android, Chrome, Gmail, Maps, Play Store, Search, and\nYouTube \u2014 are using Gemini.\nOur Google Cloud products, including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, help organizations stay at\nthe forefront of innovation with our AI-optimized infrastructure, AI development platform, world-class models, as well as\nassistive agents and applications.\nWe believe AI has the potential to solve important societal, scientific, and engineering challenges. For example, in\n2020, Google DeepMind\u2019s AlphaFold system solved a 50-year-old protein folding challenge, and in 2024, we\nintroduced AlphaFold 3, built on the previous models, to predict the structure and interactions of all the molecules in\nlife's processes.\nWe are focused on transforming our products to provide the most helpful tools to our users and customers as we\ndeliver on our mission to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful.\nDeliver the Most Advanced, Safe, and Responsible AI\nWe aim to build the most advanced, safe, and responsible AI through a full stack of robust AI-optimized\ninfrastructure, including data centers, chips, and a global fiber network; world class research teams; and a broad global\nreach through products and platforms that touch billions of people and customers around the world.\nWe are driving efficiencies in our data centers, while making significant hardware and model improvements. For\nexample, since we started serving AI Overviews to our users, we have significantly lowered machine costs and latency\nthrough hardware, engineering, and technical breakthroughs. Our AI-optimized infrastructure allows us to use, and\noffer our customers, a range of AI accelerator options, including our own custom-built Tensor Processing Units (TPUs).\nOur teams across Alphabet leverage Gemini, as well as other AI models we have previously developed and\nannounced, to deliver the best product and service experiences for our users, advertisers, partners, customers, and\ndevelopers. We are using Gemini 2.0 in new research prototypes, including Project Astra, which explores the future\ncapabilities of a universal AI assistant and Project Mariner, an early prototype capable of taking actions in Chrome as\nan experimental extension.\nWe believe our approach to AI must be both bold and responsible. That means developing AI in a way that\nmaximizes the positive benefits to society while addressing its potential challenges, guided by our AI Principles.\nEnable Organizations and Developers to Innovate on Google Cloud\nAI is a major technology shift for enterprises. Globally, businesses from startups to large enterprises, and the\npublic sector are thinking about how to drive transformation. That is why we are focused on making it easy and\nscalable for others to innovate, and grow, with AI. That means providing advanced computing infrastructure and\nexpanding access to Google\u2019s latest AI models. Our Vertex AI platform gives developers the ability to train, tune,\naugment, test, and deploy applications using Gemini, Imagen, Veo, and other generative AI models. Gemini for Google\nCloud provides pre-packaged AI agents that can assist developers to write, document, test, and operate software as\nwell as assist cybersecurity teams to analyze, detect, protect, and respond to threats.\nImprove Knowledge, Learning, Creativity, and Productivity\nAs AI continues to improve rapidly, we are focused on transforming our products to provide our users the most\nhelpful tools. Examples include AI Overviews, which allow users to ask their most complex questions, break down\nconcepts in a format that is useful for them, or take a video and ask a question out loud, and NotebookLM, which helps\nusers understand complex information by summarizing sources and providing relevant quotes. We are embedding the\npower of generative AI to continue helping our users express themselves and get things done. For example, the\nGemini app allows users to collaborate with new AI features that include image generation capabilities, coding support,\nand app integration. Gemini for Google Workspace helps users write, organize, visualize, accelerate workflows, and\nhave richer meetings. Additionally, we are using Gemini to improve recommendations on YouTube. We also know\nbusinesses of all sizes around the world rely on Google Ads to find customers and grow their businesses \u2014 and we\n5.",

(the Company) as of December 31,\n2023 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash\nflows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial\nstatement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). In\nour opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the\nCompany at December 31, 2023 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three\nyears in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control\u2014Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 4, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion\nthereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to\nthose risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in\nthe financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates\nmade by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our\naudits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion\non the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter\nbelow, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.\n49.",

The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities\nthat have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or Level 3\nin the fair value hierarchy. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment are\nclassified within Level 3. Our valuation methods include option pricing models, market comparable approach, and\ncommon stock equivalent method, which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the\ntransaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, expected time to exit, risk free rate, and the rights\nand obligations of the securities we hold. These inputs vary significantly based on investment type.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $35.5 billion, of which\n$19.9 billion were remeasured at fair value during the year ended December 31, 2024, and were primarily classified\nwithin Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy at the time of measurement.\nDebt Securities\nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair value of investments in available-for-sale marketable debt\nsecurities by effective contractual maturity dates (in millions):\n66.",

While these net gains (losses) may have been reflected in periods prior to the period of sale, we\nbelieve they are important supplemental information as they reflect the economic net gains (losses) on the securities\nsold during the period.

Our share of gains and losses, including impairments, are\nincluded as a component of OI&E, in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Our convertible notes held for\ninvestment are recorded at amortized cost which includes unpaid principal balances, deferred origination costs, and\nany related discount or premium, net of allowances for credit losses, and are included within other non-current assets\non our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n68.",

        "text": "Financial filing text section: Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\nNote 11. Stockholders' Equity\nClass A and Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock\nOur Board of Directors has authorized three classes of stock, Class A and Class B common stock, and Class C\ncapital stock. The rights of the holders of each class of our common and capital stock are identical, except with respect\nto voting. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock\nis entitled to 10 votes per share. Class C capital stock has no voting rights, except as required by applicable law.\nShares of Class B common stock may be converted at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically\nconvert upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock.\nShare Repurchases\nIn the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, we continued to repurchase both Class A and Class C\nshares in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its stockholders, taking into account the economic\ncost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading prices and volumes of the Class A and Class C\nshares. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, we repurchased $59.3 billion, $62.2 billion, and\n$62.0 billion, respectively, of Alphabet's Class A and Class C shares.\nIn April 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $70.0\nbillion of its Class A and Class C shares. As of December 31, 2024, $44.7 billion remained available for Class A and\nClass C share repurchases.\nThe following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 Year Ended December 31, 2024\nShares Amount Shares Amount\nClass A share repurchases 78 $ 9,316 73 $ 11,855\nClass C share repurchases 450 52,868 306 50,192\nTotal share repurchases(1) 528 $ 62,184 379 $ 62,047\n(1) Shares repurchased include unsettled repurchases.\nRepurchases are executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other\ninvestment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule\n10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date.\nDividends\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, total cash dividends, which were first paid in June 2024, were $3.5\nbillion, $519 million, and $3.3 billion for Class A, Class B, and Class C shares, respectively.\nThe company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future, subject to review and approval by the\ncompany\u2019s Board of Directors in its sole discretion.\nNote 12. Net Income Per Share\nWe compute net income per share of Class A, Class B, and Class C stock using the two-class method. Basic net\nincome per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net\nincome per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutive\nsecurities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of RSUs and other contingently issuable\nshares. The dilutive effect of outstanding RSUs and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings\nper share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A\nstock assumes the conversion of Class B stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B stock does not\nassume the conversion of those shares.\nIn accordance with our certificate of incorporation, the rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the\nholders of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Furthermore, there are\na number of safeguards built into our certificate of incorporation, as well as Delaware law, which preclude our Board of\nDirectors from declaring or paying unequal per share dividends on our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock.\nSpecifically, Delaware law provides that amendments to our certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of\nadversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a given class of stock must be approved by the class of stock\nadversely affected by the proposed amendment. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that before any\nsuch amendment may be put to a stockholder vote, it must be approved by the unanimous consent of our Board of\nDirectors.\n81.",

General AI model development teams\npreviously under Google Research in our Google Services segment are reported within Alphabet-level activities\nprospectively beginning in the second quarter of 2024. As further announced, in October 2024, the Gemini app team\nthat is developing the direct consumer interface to our Gemini models joined Google DeepMind. The costs associated\nwith the Gemini app team continue to be reported within our Google Services segment.\nCertain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs\nprimarily include certain AI-focused shared R&D activities, including development costs of our general AI models;\ncorporate initiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human\nresource, and legal costs, including certain fines and settlements. Charges associated with employee severance and\noffice space reductions during 2023 and 2024 were also not allocated to our segments. Additionally, hedging gains\n(losses) related to revenue are not allocated to our segments.\nOur Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is our Chief Executive Officer, Sundar Pichai. Our CODM uses\nsegment operating income (loss) to allocate resources to our segments in our annual planning process and to assess\nthe performance of our segments, primarily by monitoring actual results versus the annual plan. Our operating\nsegments are not evaluated using asset information.\nThe following table presents revenue, profitability, and expense information about our segments (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2023 2024\nRevenues:\nGoogle Services $ 253,528 $ 272,543 $ 304,930\nGoogle Cloud 26,280 33,088 43,229\nOther Bets 1,068 1,527 1,648\nHedging gains (losses) 1,960 236 211\nTotal revenues $ 282,836 $ 307,394 $ 350,018\nOperating income (loss):\nGoogle Services $ 82,699 $ 95,858 $ 121,263\nGoogle Cloud (1,922) 1,716 6,112\nOther Bets (4,636) (4,095) (4,444)\nAlphabet-level activities (1,299) (9,186) (10,541)\nTotal income from operations $ 74,842 $ 84,293 $ 112,390\nSupplemental information about our segment expenses:\nGoogle Services:\nEmployee compensation expenses $ 43,529 $ 46,224 $ 44,560\nOther costs and expenses 127,300 130,461 139,107\nTotal Google Services costs and expenses $ 170,829 $ 176,685 $ 183,667\nGoogle Cloud:\nEmployee compensation expenses $ 16,132 $ 19,054 $ 20,519\nOther costs and expenses 12,070 12,318 16,598\nTotal Google Cloud costs and expenses $ 28,202 $ 31,372 $ 37,117\nGoogle Services and Google Cloud employee compensation expenses include the costs associated with direct\nand allocated employees.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in\nAugust 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc.\n(\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that\nprovide customers with infrastructure and platform services and collaboration tools; sales of other products and\nservices, such as apps and in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and fees received for\nsubscription-based products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated\nunder the variable interest and voting models. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUnaudited Interim Financial Information\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal\nrecurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of\nthe results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2022. We have made estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual\nresults could differ materially from these estimates.\nThese consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 filed with the SEC.\nNote 2.

The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the measurement\nalternative). Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured during the period based on observable\ntransactions are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the value based\non valuation methods which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date\nand other unobservable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. The fair value of\nnon-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment are classified within Level 3.\nGains and losses on marketable and non-marketable equity securities\nGains and losses reflected in other income (expense), net, for marketable and non-marketable equity\nsecurities are summarized below (in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2021 2022\nNet gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period $ 201 $ (74)\nNet unrealized gain (loss) on equity securities held as of the end of the period 4,636 (996)\nTotal gain (loss) recognized in other income (expense), net $ 4,837 $ (1,070)\nIn the table above, net gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period reflects the difference between the\nsale proceeds and the carrying value of the equity securities at the beginning of the period or the purchase date, if\nlater.\nCumulative net gains (losses) on equity securities sold during the period, which is summarized in the following\ntable (in millions), represents the total net gains (losses) recognized after the initial purchase date of the equity\nsecurity. While these net gains may have been reflected in periods prior to the period of sale, we believe they are\nimportant supplemental information as they reflect the economic net gains on the securities sold during the period.\nCumulative net gains are calculated as the difference between the sale price and the initial purchase price for the\nequity security sold during the period.\nEquity Securities Sold\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2021 2022\nTotal sale price $ 725 $ 364\nTotal initial cost 357 260\nCumulative net gains $ 368 $ 104\n13",

        "text": "Financial filing text section: Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\nNon-marketable equity securities\nThe following is a summary of unrealized gains and losses recorded in other income (expense), net, which are\nincluded as adjustments to the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities held as of the end of the period (in\nmillions):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2021 2022\nUnrealized gains on non-marketable equity securities $ 4,678 $ 838\nUnrealized losses on non-marketable equity securities (including impairment)\n(2) (378)\nTotal unrealized gain (loss) recognized on non-marketable equity\nsecurities $ 4,676 $ 460\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2022, included in the $28.7 billion of non-marketable equity\nsecurities held as of the end of the period, $3.1 billion were measured at fair value resulting in a net unrealized gain\nof $0.5 billion.\nEquity securities accounted for under the Equity Method\nAs of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, equity securities accounted for under the equity method had a\ncarrying value of approximately $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. Our share of gains and losses, including\nimpairments, are included as a component of other income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of\nIncome. See Note 6 for further details on other income (expense), net.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe enter into derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary\nrisk managed with derivative instruments is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the\nrisk that our cash flows, earnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to\nother risks and enhance investment returns.\nWe recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair\nvalue and classify the derivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts\n(an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values where both the\npurchased and written options are with the same counterparty. For other derivative contracts, we present at gross\nfair values. We primarily record changes in the fair value in the Consolidated Statements of Income as either other\nincome (expense), net, or revenues, or in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in AOCI, as discussed below.\nWe enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of\ntransactions with the same counterparty. Further, we enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for\ncollateral to be received or pledged when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from\ncontractually established thresholds. Cash collateral received related to derivative instruments under our collateral\nsecurity arrangements are included in other current assets with a corresponding liability. Cash and non-cash\ncollateral pledged related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements are included in other\ncurrent assets.\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge\ncertain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have\nmaturities of 24 months or less.\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and\nsubsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude the change in\nforward points and time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness. The initial value of the excluded\ncomponent is amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument and recognized in revenues.\nThe difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to revenues is\nrecorded in AOCI. If the hedged transactions become probable of not occurring, the corresponding amounts in AOCI\nare reclassified to other income (expense), net in the period of de-designation.\nAs of March 31, 2022, the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect\nwas $356 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings within the next 12 months.\n15",

The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using certain market rates, as well\nas our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals. No amounts have been borrowed under the\ncredit facilities.\nAs of March 31, 2022, we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with a total carrying value of $12.8 billion.\nSee Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form\n10-Q for further information on our debt.\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn April 2021, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $50.0 billion of its\nClass C stock. In July 2021, the Board of Directors of Alphabet approved an amendment to the April 2021\nauthorization, permitting the company to repurchase both Class A and Class C shares in a manner deemed in the\nbest interest of the company and its stockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market\nconditions, including the relative trading prices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. As of March 31,\n2022, $4.1 billion remains available for Class A and Class C share repurchases under the amended authorization.\nIn accordance with the authorizations of the Board of Directors of Alphabet, during the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2022, we repurchased and subsequently retired 4.9 million aggregate shares for $13.3 billion. Of the\naggregate amount repurchased and subsequently retired during the three months ended March 31, 2022, 0.2\nmillion shares were Class A stock for $660 million and 4.7 million shares were Class C stock for $12.6 billion.\nIn April 2022, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional\n$70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its\nstockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading\nprices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares.\nRepurchases are executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other\ninvestment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through\nRule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date.\nEuropean Commission Fines\nIn 2017, 2018 and 2019, the EC announced decisions that certain actions taken by Google infringed European\ncompetition law and imposed fines of \u20ac2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017), \u20ac4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of\nJune 30, 2018), and \u20ac1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019), respectively. While each EC decision is under\nappeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets\nas we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nTaxes\nAs of March 31, 2022, we had short-term and long-term income taxes payable of $805 million and $5.7 billion\nrelated to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\"). As\npermitted by the Tax Act, we will pay the transition tax in annual interest-free installments through 2025. We also\nhave taxes payable of $3.7 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of March 31, 2022.\nPending Acquisition\nIn March 2022, we entered into an agreement to acquire Mandiant, a leader in dynamic cyber defense and\nresponse, for $23.00 per share, in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $5.4 billion, net of cash and debt.\nSee Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form\n10-Q.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nSee Part II, Item 7, \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021.\nAvailable Information\nOur website is located at www.abc.xyz, and our investor relations website is located at www.abc.xyz/investor.\nOur Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and our Proxy\nStatements, and any amendments to these reports, are available through our investor relations website, free of\ncharge, after we file them with the SEC.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in\nAugust 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc.\n(\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that\nprovide enterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration\ntools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received\nfor subscription-based products.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated\nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUnaudited Interim Financial Information\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal\nrecurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of\nthe results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2023. We have made estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual\nresults could differ materially from these estimates.\nThese consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the SEC.\nChange in Accounting Estimate\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and\nadjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain\nnetwork equipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal\nyear 2023. Based on the carrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December 31, 2022, and\nthose placed in service during the quarter ended March 31, 2023, the effect of this change in estimate was a\nreduction in depreciation expense of $988 million and an increase in net income of $770 million, or $0.06 per basic\nand $0.06 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2023.\nStock Split Effected in the Form of a Stock Dividend (\u201cStock Split\u201d)\nOn July 15, 2022, we executed a 20-for-one stock split of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. All prior\nperiod references made to share or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and\napplicable disclosures prior to the effective date have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock\nSplit.\nPrior Period Reclassifications\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.\n10",

Financial Instruments\nFair Value Measurements\nInvestments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable equity securities are measured at fair value and classified within\nLevel 1 and Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets\nor inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets.\nDebt securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we\nuse quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market\nobservable inputs to determine fair value. For certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value\noption for which changes in fair value are recorded in other income (expense), net. The fair value option was\nelected for these securities to align with the unrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts.\nThe following tables summarize our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities measured at fair value\non a recurring basis (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2022\nGross Gross Cash and\nFair Value Adjusted Unrealized Unrealized Cash Marketable\nHierarchy Cost Gains Losses Fair Value Equivalents Securities\nFair value changes\nrecorded in other\ncomprehensive\nincome\nTime deposits(1) Level 2 $ 5,297 $ 0 $ 0 $ 5,297 $ 5,293 $ 4\nGovernment bonds Level 2 41,036 64 (2,045) 39,055 283 38,772\nCorporate debt Level 2\nsecurities 28,578 8 (1,569) 27,017 1 27,016\nMortgage-backed and\nasset-backed\nsecurities Level 2 16,176 5 (1,242) 14,939 0 14,939\nTotal investments\nwith fair value\nchange reflected in\nother\ncomprehensive\nincome(2) $ 91,087 $ 77 $ (4,856) $ 86,308 $ 5,577 $ 80,731\nFair value\nadjustments\nrecorded in net\nincome\nMoney market funds Level 1 $ 7,234 $ 7,234 $ 0\nCurrent marketable Level 1\nequity securities(3) 4,013 0 4,013\nMutual funds Level 2 339 0 339\nGovernment bonds Level 2 1,877 440 1,437\nCorporate debt Level 2\nsecurities 3,744 65 3,679\nMortgage-backed and Level 2\nasset-backed\nsecurities 1,686 2 1,684\nTotal investments\nwith fair value\nchange recorded in\nnet income $ 18,893 $ 7,741 $ 11,152\nCash 0 8,561 0\nTotal $ 91,087 $ 77 $ (4,856) $ 105,201 $ 21,879 $ 91,883\n(1) The majority of our time deposits are domestic deposits.\n(2) Represents gross unrealized gains and losses for debt securities recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income\n(AOCI).\n12",

The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities\nthat have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or\nLevel 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the value based on valuation methods which may include a\ncombination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including\nvolatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. The fair value of non-marketable equity securities that\nhave been remeasured due to impairment are classified within Level 3.\nAs of March 31, 2023 the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $29.1 billion, of which\n$10.7 billion were re-measured at fair value during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and primarily classified\nas Level 2 investments.\n13",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in\nAugust 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc.\n(\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that\nprovide enterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration\ntools; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app\npurchases, and devices.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated\nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUnaudited Interim Financial Information\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal\nrecurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of\nthe results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2024. We have made estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual\nresults could differ materially from these estimates.\nThese consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update\n(ASU) 2023-07 \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\" which expands\nannual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about\nsignificant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2024, and for\ninterim periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential\neffect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 \"Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures\" to expand the disclosure requirements for income taxes, specifically related to the rate reconciliation\nand income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early\nadoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential effect that the updated standard will have on our\nfinancial statement disclosures.\nPrior Period Reclassifications\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.\n10",

The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities\nthat have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or\nLevel 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment\nare classified within Level 3. Our valuation methods include option pricing models, market comparable approach,\nand common stock equivalent method, which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the\ntransaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, expected time to exit, risk free rate, and the\nrights, and obligations of the securities we hold. These inputs significantly vary based on investment type.\nAs of March 31, 2024, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $31.4 billion, of which\n$13.6 billion were remeasured at fair value during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and primarily classified\nwithin Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy at the time of measurement.\n13",

In connection with the cash dividend (and any future dividend\nthe company\u2019s Board of Directors may declare from time to time), the company will also award dividend equivalent\nunits to holders of all unvested stock units in accordance with the Alphabet Inc. Amended and Restated 2021 Stock\nPlan and pursuant to each holder\u2019s outstanding stock unit grant agreements, as amended.\nEuropean Commission Fines\nIn 2017, 2018 and 2019, the EC announced decisions that certain actions taken by Google infringed European\ncompetition law and imposed fines of \u20ac2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017), \u20ac4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of\nJune 30, 2018), and \u20ac1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019), respectively. On September 14, 2022, the\nGeneral Court reduced the 2018 fine from \u20ac4.3 billion to \u20ac4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal to the\nEuropean Court of Justice.\nWhile each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities\non our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines. For\nadditional information, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nTaxes\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had income taxes payable of $4.2 billion, of which $2.1 billion was short-term,\nrelated to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\"). As\npermitted by the Tax Act, we will pay the transition tax in annual interest-free installments through 2025. We also\nhave long-term taxes payable of $7.1 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of March 31, 2024.\nPurchase Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had material purchase commitments and other contractual obligations of $44.0\nbillion, of which $29.4 billion was short-term. These amounts primarily consist of purchase orders for certain\ntechnical infrastructure as well as the non-cancelable portion or the minimum cancellation fee in certain agreements\nrelated to commitments to purchase licenses, including content licenses, inventory and network capacity. For those\nagreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities\nand/or pricing as of March 31, 2024. In certain instances, the amount of our contractual obligations may change\nbased on the expected timing of order fulfillment from our suppliers. For more information related to our content\nlicenses, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item I of this Quarterly Report\non Form 10-Q.\nIn addition we regularly enter into multi-year, non-cancellable agreements to purchase renewable energy and\nenergy attributes, such as renewable energy certificates. These agreements do not include a minimum dollar\ncommitment. The amounts to be paid under these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated\nand are not readily determinable.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nSee Part II, Item 7, \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\n41",

UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nThe following table presents information with respect to Alphabet's repurchases of Class A and Class C stock\nduring the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\nTotal Number of Approximate\nShares Dollar Value of\nPurchased as Shares that May\nTotal Number of Total Number of Part of Publicly Yet Be\nClass A Shares Class C Shares Announced Purchased\nPurchased Purchased Average Price Average Price Programs Under the\n(in thousands) (in thousands) Paid per Class Paid per Class (in thousands) Program\nPeriod (1) (1) A Share (2) C Share (2) (1) (in millions)\nJanuary 1 - 31 9,717 29,623 $ 145.11 $ 146.28 39,340 $ 30,648\nFebruary 1 - 29 7,568 28,804 $ 143.82 $ 144.75 36,372 $ 25,429\nMarch 1 - 31 5,949 29,230 $ 143.08 $ 143.86 35,179 $ 20,404\nTotal 23,234 87,657 110,891\n(1) Repurchases are being executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other\ninvestment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule\n10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date. For additional information related to share\nrepurchases, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q.\n(2) Average price paid per share includes costs associated with the repurchases.\nITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION\n10b5-1 Trading Plans\nDuring the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024, no Section 16 director or officer adopted, modified, or\nterminated a \u201cRule 10b5-1 trading arrangement\u201d (as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act).\nThere were no \u201cnon-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements\u201d (as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K of the\nExchange Act) adopted, modified or terminated during the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024 by our directors and\nSection 16 officers.\nCompensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers\nOn April 16, 2024, the Leadership Development, Inclusion and Compensation Committee of the Board of\nDirectors of Alphabet approved the accrual of dividend equivalent units to holders of all unvested stock units,\nsubject to the approval of a dividend declaration by the Board of Directors of the Company (which was approved\nand announced on April 25, 2024). This approval covers both performance stock unit awards and Google stock unit\nawards, and applies both to currently outstanding and future equity awards. For the avoidance of doubt, the\ncorresponding amendments to the respective stock unit grant agreements will apply both to currently outstanding\ngrant agreements and all future grant agreements. As stock units are not outstanding shares of stock and thus\nwould not otherwise be entitled to participate in any dividends (including the one referenced above), the crediting of\ndividend equivalent units is intended to preserve the equity-based incentives intended by the Company when the\nstock units were granted and to treat the holders of stock units consistently with all stockholders.\n44",

The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities\nthat have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or\nLevel 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment\nare classified within Level 3. Our valuation methods include option pricing models, market comparable approach,\nand common stock equivalent method, which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the\ntransaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, expected time to exit, risk free rate, and the\nrights, and obligations of the securities we hold. These inputs vary significantly based on investment type.\nAs of March 31, 2025, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $48.6 billion, of which\n$25.0 billion were remeasured at fair value during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and were primarily\nclassified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy at the time of measurement.\n13",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in\nAugust 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc.\n(\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that\nprovide customers with infrastructure and platform services and collaboration tools; sales of other products and\nservices, such as apps and in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and fees received for\nsubscription-based products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated\nunder the variable interest and voting models. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUnaudited Interim Financial Information\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal\nrecurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of\nthe results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2022. We have made estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual\nresults could differ materially from these estimates.\nThese consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 filed with the SEC.\nStock Split Effected in the Form of a Stock Dividend (\u201cStock Split\u201d)\nOn February 1, 2022, the company announced that the Board of Directors had approved and declared a 20-\nfor-one stock split in the form of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the company\u2019s Class A, Class\nB, and Class C stock. The Stock Split had a record date of July 1, 2022 and an effective date of July 15, 2022. The\npar value per share of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock remains unchanged at $0.001 per share after the\nStock Split. All references made to share or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial\nstatements and applicable disclosures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split.\nNote 2.

The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the measurement\nalternative). Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured during the period based on observable\ntransactions are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the value based\non valuation methods which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date\nand other unobservable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. The fair value of\nnon-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment are classified within Level 3.\nGains and losses on marketable and non-marketable equity securities\nGains and losses (including impairments) reflected in other income (expense), net, for marketable and non-\nmarketable equity securities are summarized below (in millions):\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n2021 2022 2021 2022\nNet gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period $ 138 $ 26 $ 506 $ (230)\nNet unrealized gain (loss) on equity securities held as of\nthe end of the period 2,634 (277) 7,103 (1,091)\nTotal gain (loss) recognized in other income\n(expense), net $ 2,772 $ (251) $ 7,609 $ (1,321)\nIn the table above, net gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period reflects the difference between the\nsale proceeds and the carrying value of the equity securities at the beginning of the period or the purchase date, if\nlater.\nCumulative net gains (losses) on equity securities sold during the period, which is summarized in the following\ntable (in millions), represents the total net gains (losses) recognized after the initial purchase date of the equity\nsecurity. While these net gains may have been reflected in periods prior to the period of sale, we believe they are\nimportant supplemental information as they reflect the economic net gains on the securities sold during the period.\nCumulative net gains are calculated as the difference between the sale price and the initial purchase price for the\nequity security sold during the period.\nEquity Securities Sold\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n2021 2022 2021 2022\nTotal sale price $ 2,629 $ 645 $ 3,353 $ 1,335\nTotal initial cost 409 168 766 428\nCumulative net gains(1) $ 2,220 $ 477 $ 2,587 $ 907\n(1) Cumulative net gains for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 excludes cumulative losses of $684 million\nresulting from our equity derivatives, which hedged the changes in fair value of certain marketable equity securities sold.\nThe associated derivative liabilities arising from these losses were settled against our holdings of the underlying equity\nsecurities.\n14",

        "text": "Financial filing text section: Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\nNon-marketable equity securities\nThe following is a summary of unrealized gains and losses (including impairments) recorded in other income\n(expense), net, which are included as adjustments to the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities held as\nof the end of the period (in millions):\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n2021 2022 2021 2022\nUnrealized gains on non-marketable equity securities $ 1,852 $ 2,179 $ 5,128 $ 3,016\nUnrealized losses on non-marketable equity securities\n(including impairments) (65) (1,268) (67) (1,645)\nTotal unrealized gain (loss) recognized on non-\nmarketable equity securities $ 1,787 $ 911 $ 5,061 $ 1,371\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2022, included in the $28.9 billion of non-marketable equity securities\nheld as of the end of the period, $10.8 billion were measured at fair value resulting in a net unrealized gain of $911\nmillion.\nEquity securities accounted for under the Equity Method\nAs of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2022, equity securities accounted for under the equity method had a\ncarrying value of approximately $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. Our share of gains and losses, including\nimpairments, are included as a component of other income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of\nIncome. See Note 6 for further details on other income (expense), net.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe enter into derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary\nrisk managed with derivative instruments is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the\nrisk that our cash flows, earnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to\nother risks and enhance investment returns.\nWe recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair\nvalue and classify the derivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts\n(an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values where both the\npurchased and written options are with the same counterparty. For other derivative contracts, we present at gross\nfair values. We primarily record changes in the fair value in the Consolidated Statements of Income as either other\nincome (expense), net, or revenues, or in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in AOCI, as discussed below.\nWe enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of\ntransactions with the same counterparty. Further, we enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for\ncollateral to be received or pledged when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from\ncontractually established thresholds. Cash collateral received related to derivative instruments under our collateral\nsecurity arrangements are included in other current assets with a corresponding liability. Cash and non-cash\ncollateral pledged related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements are included in other\ncurrent assets.\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge\ncertain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have\nmaturities of 24 months or less.\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and\nsubsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude the change in\nforward points and time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness. The initial value of the excluded\ncomponent is amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument and recognized in revenues.\nThe difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to revenues is\nrecorded in AOCI. If the hedged transactions become probable of not occurring, the corresponding amounts in AOCI\nare reclassified to other income (expense), net in the period of de-designation.\nAs of June 30, 2022, the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect was\n$1.1 billion, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings within the next 12 months.\n16",

The increase in cost-\nper-impression from the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 to the three and six months ended June 30,\n2022 was driven by a number of interrelated factors including ongoing product and policy changes, improvements\nwe have made in ad formats and delivery, changes in device mix, geographic mix, product mix, and property mix.\nGoogle other revenues\nGoogle other revenues decreased $70 million from the three months ended June 30, 2021 to the three months\nended June 30, 2022 primarily driven by a decrease in Google Play revenues, partially offset by growth in YouTube\nnon-advertising revenues. The decrease in Google Play revenues was primarily driven by the fee structure changes\nwe announced in 2021 as well as a decrease in buyer spending. The growth in YouTube non-advertising was largely\ndue to an increase in paid subscribers.\nGoogle other revenues increased $247 million from the six months ended June 30, 2021 to the six months\nended June 30, 2022.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August\n2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\")\nbecame the successor issuer to Google.\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that\nprovide enterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration\ntools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received\nfor subscription-based products.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated\nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUnaudited Interim Financial Information\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal\nrecurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of\nthe results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2023. We have made estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual\nresults could differ materially from these estimates.\nThese consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the SEC.\nChange in Accounting Estimate\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and\nadjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain\nnetwork equipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal\nyear 2023. Based on the carrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December 31, 2022, and\nthose placed in service during the six months ended June 30, 2023, the effect of this change in estimate was a\nreduction in depreciation expense of $966 million and $2.0 billion and an increase in net income of $752 million and\n$1.5 billion, or $0.06 and $0.12 per basic and $0.06 and $0.12 per diluted share, for the three and six months ended\nJune 30, 2023, respectively.\nPrior Period Reclassifications\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.\n11",

Financial Instruments\nFair Value Measurements\nInvestments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable equity securities are measured at fair value and classified within\nLevel 1 and Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets\nor inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets.\nDebt securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we\nuse quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market\nobservable inputs to determine fair value. For certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value\noption for which changes in fair value are recorded in other income (expense), net. The fair value option was\nelected for these securities to align with the unrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts.\nThe following tables summarize our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities measured at fair value\non a recurring basis (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2022\nGross Gross Cash and\nFair Value Adjusted Unrealized Unrealized Cash Marketable\nHierarchy Cost Gains Losses Fair Value Equivalents Securities\nFair value changes\nrecorded in other\ncomprehensive\nincome\nTime deposits Level 2 $ 5,297 $ 0 $ 0 $ 5,297 $ 5,293 $ 4\nGovernment bonds Level 2 41,036 64 (2,045) 39,055 283 38,772\nCorporate debt Level 2\nsecurities 28,578 8 (1,569) 27,017 1 27,016\nMortgage-backed and\nasset-backed\nsecurities Level 2 16,176 5 (1,242) 14,939 0 14,939\nTotal investments\nwith fair value\nchange reflected in\nother\ncomprehensive\nincome(1) $ 91,087 $ 77 $ (4,856) $ 86,308 $ 5,577 $ 80,731\nFair value\nadjustments\nrecorded in net\nincome\nMoney market funds Level 1 $ 7,234 $ 7,234 $ 0\nCurrent marketable Level 1\nequity securities(2) 4,013 0 4,013\nMutual funds Level 2 339 0 339\nGovernment bonds Level 2 1,877 440 1,437\nCorporate debt Level 2\nsecurities 3,744 65 3,679\nMortgage-backed and Level 2\nasset-backed\nsecurities 1,686 2 1,684\nTotal investments\nwith fair value\nchange recorded in\nnet income $ 18,893 $ 7,741 $ 11,152\nCash 0 8,561 0\nTotal $ 91,087 $ 77 $ (4,856) $ 105,201 $ 21,879 $ 91,883\n(1) Represents gross unrealized gains and losses for debt securities recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income\n(AOCI).\n(2) The long-term portion of marketable equity securities (subject to long-term lock-up restrictions) of $803 million as of\nDecember 31, 2022 is included within other non-current assets.\n13",

The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities\nthat have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or\nLevel 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the value based on valuation methods which may include a\ncombination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including\nvolatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. The fair value of non-marketable equity securities that\nhave been remeasured due to impairment are classified within Level 3.\nAs of June 30, 2023 the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $29.1 billion, of which $1.5\nbillion were remeasured at fair value during the three months ended June 30, 2023 and primarily classified as Level\n3.\n14",

Our share of gains and losses, including impairments,\nare included as a component of other income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note\n6 for further details on other income (expense), net.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe use derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk\nmanaged is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows,\nearnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate\nfluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance\ninvestment returns.\nWe recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the\nderivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy\ncomprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at\ngross fair values. The accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation.\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge\ncertain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have\nmaturities of 24 months or less.\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and\nsubsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points\nand time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life\nof the hedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and\nthe amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.\nAs of June 30, 2023 the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect was\n$24 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.\nFair Value Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our\nmarketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in\nthe assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net, along with the offsetting\ngains and losses of the related hedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in other income (expense), net.\nNet Investment Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks\nrelated to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of\nhedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude\nforward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in\nother income (expense), net.\nOther Derivatives\nWe enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to\nhedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the\nfunctional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting\nhedges are primarily recorded in other income (expense), net along with the foreign currency gains and losses on\nmonetary assets and liabilities.\nWe also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates,\ncommodity prices, credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns. From time to time, we enter into derivatives\nto hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains and losses arising from other\nderivatives are primarily reflected within the \u201cother\u201d component of other income (expense), net. See Note 6 for\nfurther details.\n17",

Additionally, cost-per-click was\nadversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and, to a\nlesser extent, for the three months ended June 30, 2023.\nImpressions and cost-per-impression\nThe following table presents year-over-year changes in impressions and cost-per-impression (expressed as a\npercentage):\nThree Months Six Months\nEnded June 30, Ended June 30,\n2023 2023\nImpressions change 0% (2)%\nCost-per-impression change (5)% (5)%\nImpressions were relatively unchanged from the three months ended June 30, 2022 to the three months ended\nJune 30, 2023, as an increase in AdMob was largely offset by decreases in AdSense and Google Ad Manager. The\ndecrease in cost-per-impression from the three months ended June 30, 2022 to the three months ended June 30,\n2023 was driven by a number of interrelated factors including ongoing product and policy changes, changes in\ndevice mix, geographic mix, product mix, and property mix, as well as the adverse effect of changes in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates.\nImpressions decreased from the six months ended June 30, 2022 to the six months ended June 30, 2023\ndriven by decreases in Google Ad Manager and AdSense, partially offset by an increase in AdMob. The decrease in\ncost-per-impression from the six months ended June 30, 2022 to the six months ended June 30, 2023 was driven\nby a number of interrelated factors including ongoing product and policy changes, changes in device mix,\ngeographic mix, product mix, and property mix, as well as the adverse effect of changes in foreign currency\nexchange rates.\nGoogle other revenues\nGoogle other revenues increased $1.6 billion and $2.2 billion from the three and six months ended June 30,\n2022 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 primarily driven by growth in YouTube non-advertising,\nlargely due to an increase in paid subscribers, and growth in hardware, due to increased sales of Pixel devices, in\nlarge part due to product launch timing. Additionally, growth was adversely affected by changes in foreign currency\nexchange rates for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and, to a lesser extent, for the three months ended June\n30, 2023.\nGoogle Cloud\nGoogle Cloud revenues increased $1.8 billion and $3.4 billion from the three and six months ended June 30,\n2022 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. Growth was primarily driven by Google Cloud\nPlatform followed by Google Workspace offerings. Google Cloud's infrastructure and platform services were the\nlargest drivers of growth in Google Cloud Platform.\n39",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in\nAugust 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc.\n(\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that\nprovide enterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration\ntools; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app\npurchases, and devices.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated\nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUnaudited Interim Financial Information\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal\nrecurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of\nthe results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2024. We have made estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual\nresults could differ materially from these estimates.\nThese consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update\n(ASU) 2023-07 \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\" which expands\nannual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about\nsignificant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2024, and for\ninterim periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential\neffect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 \"Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures\" to expand the disclosure requirements for income taxes. Upon adoption we will be required to disclose\nstandardized categories in the rate reconciliation in both percentage and dollar amounts. ASU 2023-09 will also\nrequire income taxes paid to be disaggregated by jurisdiction, among other disclosure requirements. We will adopt\nASU 2023-09 for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2025.\nPrior Period Reclassifications\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.\n11",

The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities\nthat have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or\nLevel 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment\nare classified within Level 3. Our valuation methods include option pricing models, market comparable approach,\nand common stock equivalent method, which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the\ntransaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, expected time to exit, risk free rate, and the\nrights, and obligations of the securities we hold. These inputs significantly vary based on investment type.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $31.6 billion, of which $2.2\nbillion were remeasured at fair value during the three months ended June 30, 2024 and classified within Level 2 and\nLevel 3 of the fair value hierarchy at the time of measurement.\n14",

Our share of gains and losses, including\nimpairments, are included as a component of OI&E, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 6 for\nfurther details on OI&E.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe use derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk\nmanaged is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows,\nearnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate\nfluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance\ninvestment returns.\nWe recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the\nderivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy\ncomprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at\ngross fair values. The accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation.\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge\ncertain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States (U.S.) dollar. These\ncontracts have maturities of 24 months or less.\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and\nsubsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points\nand time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life\nof the hedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and\nthe amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect was\n$300 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.\nFair Value Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our\nmarketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in\nthe assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OI&E, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the\nrelated hedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize\nchanges in the excluded component in OI&E.\nNet Investment Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks\nrelated to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of\nhedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude\nforward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in\nOI&E.\nOther Derivatives\nWe enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to\nhedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the\nfunctional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting\nhedges are primarily recorded in OI&E along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and\nliabilities.\nWe also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates,\ncommodity prices, and credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns. From time to time, we enter into\nderivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains and losses arising\nfrom other derivatives are primarily reflected within the \u201cother\u201d component of OI&E. See Note 6 for further details.\n17",

In April 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to\nrepurchase up to an additional $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares. As of June 30, 2024, $74.9 billion\nremained available for Class A and Class C share repurchases.\nThe following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2024 Six Months Ended June 30, 2024\nShares Amount Shares Amount\nClass A share repurchases 19 $ 3,265 43 $ 6,615\nClass C share repurchases 73 12,333 160 25,040\nTotal share repurchases(1) 92 $ 15,598 203 $ 31,655\n(1) Shares repurchased include unsettled repurchases as of June 30, 2024.\nFor additional information, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of\nthis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nDividend Program\nOn April 25, 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet declared a cash dividend of $0.20 per share to\nstockholders of record as of June 10, 2024, on each of the company\u2019s Class A, Class B, and Class C shares. These\ndividends were paid on June 17, 2024, totaling to $1.2 billion, $173 million, and $1.1 billion for Class A, Class B, and\nClass C shares, respectively.\nThe company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future, subject to review and approval by the\ncompany\u2019s Board of Directors in its sole discretion.\nEuropean Commission Fines\nIn 2017, 2018, and 2019, the EC announced decisions that certain actions taken by Google infringed\nEuropean competition law and imposed fines of \u20ac2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017), \u20ac4.3 billion ($5.1\nbillion as of June 30, 2018), and \u20ac1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019), respectively. On September 14,\n2022, the General Court reduced the 2018 fine from \u20ac4.3 billion to \u20ac4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal to\nthe European Court of Justice.\nWhile each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities\non our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines. For\nadditional information, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nTaxes\nAs of June 30, 2024, we had short-term income taxes payable of $2.7 billion, related to a one-time transition\ntax payable incurred as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\"). As permitted by the Tax Act, we will\npay the transition tax in annual interest-free installments through 2025. We also have long-term taxes payable of\n$7.7 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of June 30, 2024.\n46",

The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities\nthat have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or\nLevel 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment\nare classified within Level 3. Our valuation methods include option pricing models, market comparable approach,\nand common stock equivalent method, which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the\ntransaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, expected time to exit, risk free rate, and the\nrights, and obligations of the securities we hold. These inputs vary significantly based on investment type.\nAs of June 30, 2025, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $49.8 billion, of which $3.2\nbillion was remeasured at fair value during the three months ended June 30, 2025 and was primarily classified\nwithin Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy at the time of measurement.\n15",

The increase was primarily due to\nan increase in net unrealized gains on equity securities resulting from market-driven changes and fair value\nadjustments related to observable transactions, and increased net gains on debt securities due to lower market\ninterest rates.\nOI&E, net increased $10.9 billion from the six months ended June 30, 2024 to the six months ended June 30,\n2025.

This increase was primarily due to a decrease in SBC-related tax benefits, and a non-deductible legal\nsettlement in the U.S., partially offset by changes in prior period tax positions.\nThe effective tax rate increased from the six months ended June 30, 2024 to the six months ended June 30,\n2025. This increase was primarily due to a decrease in SBC-related tax benefits, lower effective tax rate impacts in\nthe U.S. federal Foreign Derived Intangible Income tax deduction, and a non-deductible legal settlement in the U.S.,\npartially offset by changes in prior period tax positions.\nOn July 4, 2025, the OBBBA was signed into law. This legislation includes changes to U.S. federal tax law,\nwhich may be subject to further clarification and the issuance of interpretive guidance. We are assessing the\nlegislation and its effect on our consolidated financial statements, which we expect to begin reflecting in the three\nmonth period ended September 30, 2025.\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development is coordinating negotiations among more than\n140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus around substantial changes to international tax policies,\n47",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in\nAugust 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc.\n(\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that\nprovide customers with infrastructure and platform services and collaboration tools; sales of other products and\nservices, such as apps and in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and fees received for\nsubscription-based products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated\nunder the variable interest and voting models. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUnaudited Interim Financial Information\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal\nrecurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of\nthe results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2022. We have made estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual\nresults could differ materially from these estimates.\nThese consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 filed with the SEC.\nStock Split Effected in the Form of a Stock Dividend (\u201cStock Split\u201d)\nOn February 1, 2022, the company announced that the Board of Directors had approved and declared a 20-\nfor-one stock split in the form of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the company\u2019s Class A, Class\nB, and Class C stock. The Stock Split had a record date of July 1, 2022 and an effective date of July 15, 2022. The\npar value per share of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock remains unchanged at $0.001 per share after the\nStock Split. All prior period references made to share or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated\nfinancial statements and applicable disclosures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock\nSplit.\n11",

See Note 6 for further details on other income (expense), net.\nEquity Investments\nThe following discusses our marketable equity securities, non-marketable equity securities, gains and losses\non marketable and non-marketable equity securities, as well as our equity securities accounted for under the equity\nmethod.\nOur marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds measured at fair value and classified\nwithin Level 1 and 2 in the fair value hierarchy because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets\nor inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets.\nOur non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable\nmarket values. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the measurement\nalternative). Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured during the period based on observable\ntransactions are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the value based\non valuation methods which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date\nand other unobservable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. The fair value of\nnon-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment are classified within Level 3.\nGains and losses on marketable and non-marketable equity securities\nGains and losses (including impairments) reflected in other income (expense), net, for marketable and non-\nmarketable equity securities are summarized below (in millions):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2021 2022 2021 2022\nNet gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period $ (36) $ (73) $ 545 $ (355)\nNet unrealized gain (loss) on equity securities held as of\nthe end of the period 2,157 (574) 9,185 (1,613)\nTotal gain (loss) recognized in other income\n(expense), net $ 2,121 $ (647) $ 9,730 $ (1,968)\nIn the table above, net gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period reflects the difference between the\nsale proceeds and the carrying value of the equity securities at the beginning of the period or the purchase date, if\nlater.\n14",

The primary\nrisk managed with derivative instruments is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the\nrisk that our cash flows, earnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to\nother risks and enhance investment returns.\nWe recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair\nvalue and classify the derivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts\n(an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values where both the\npurchased and written options are with the same counterparty.

We primarily record changes in the fair value in the Consolidated Statements of Income as either other\nincome (expense), net, or revenues, or in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in AOCI, as discussed below.\nWe enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of\ntransactions with the same counterparty. Further, we enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for\ncollateral to be received or pledged when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from\ncontractually established thresholds. Cash collateral received related to derivative instruments under our collateral\nsecurity arrangements are included in other current assets with a corresponding liability. Cash and non-cash\ncollateral pledged related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements are included in other\ncurrent assets.\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge\ncertain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have\nmaturities of 24 months or less.\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and\nsubsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude the change in\nforward points and time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness. The initial value of the excluded\ncomponent is amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument and recognized in revenues.\nThe difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to revenues is\nrecorded in AOCI. If the hedged transactions become probable of not occurring, the corresponding amounts in AOCI\nare reclassified to other income (expense), net in the period of de-designation.\nAs of September 30, 2022, the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax\neffect was $1.9 billion, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings within the next 12 months.\nFair Value Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our\ninvestments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in the\nassessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net, along with the offsetting gains\nand losses of the related hedged items. We exclude changes in forward points from the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in other income (expense), net.\nNet Investment Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks\nrelated to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of\nhedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude\nchanges in forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded\ncomponent in other income (expense), net.\nOther Derivatives\nOther derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist primarily of foreign currency forward contracts\nthat we use to hedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies\nother than the functional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these contracts, as well as the related costs,\nare recognized in other income (expense), net, along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets\nand liabilities.\nWe also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates,\ncommodity prices, credit exposures and to enhance investment returns. Additionally, from time to time, we enter into\nderivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains (losses) arising from\nthese derivatives are reflected within the \"other\" component of other income (expense), net and the offsetting\nrecognized gains (losses) on the marketable equity securities are reflected within the gain (loss) on equity\nsecurities, net component of other income (expense), net.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in\nAugust 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc.\n(\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that\nprovide enterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration\ntools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received\nfor subscription-based products.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated\nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUnaudited Interim Financial Information\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal\nrecurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of\nthe results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2023. We have made estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual\nresults could differ materially from these estimates.\nThese consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the SEC.\nChange in Accounting Estimate\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and\nadjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain\nnetwork equipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal\nyear 2023. Based on the carrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December 31, 2022, and\nthose placed in service during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the effect of this change in estimate\nwas a reduction in depreciation expense of $977 million and $2.9 billion and an increase in net income of $761\nmillion and $2.3 billion, or $0.06 and $0.18 per basic and $0.06 and $0.18 per diluted share, for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nPrior Period Reclassifications\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.\n11",

Financial Instruments\nFair Value Measurements\nInvestments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable equity securities are measured at fair value and classified within\nLevel 1 and Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets\nor inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets.\nDebt securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we\nuse quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market\nobservable inputs to determine fair value. For certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value\noption for which changes in fair value are recorded in other income (expense), net. The fair value option was\nelected for these securities to align with the unrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts.\nThe following tables summarize our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities measured at fair value\non a recurring basis (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2022\nGross Gross Cash and\nFair Value Adjusted Unrealized Unrealized Cash Marketable\nHierarchy Cost Gains Losses Fair Value Equivalents Securities\nFair value changes\nrecorded in other\ncomprehensive\nincome\nTime deposits Level 2 $ 5,297 $ 0 $ 0 $ 5,297 $ 5,293 $ 4\nGovernment bonds Level 2 41,036 64 (2,045) 39,055 283 38,772\nCorporate debt Level 2\nsecurities 28,578 8 (1,569) 27,017 1 27,016\nMortgage-backed and\nasset-backed\nsecurities Level 2 16,176 5 (1,242) 14,939 0 14,939\nTotal investments\nwith fair value\nchange reflected in\nother\ncomprehensive\nincome(1) $ 91,087 $ 77 $ (4,856) $ 86,308 $ 5,577 $ 80,731\nFair value\nadjustments\nrecorded in net\nincome\nMoney market funds Level 1 $ 7,234 $ 7,234 $ 0\nCurrent marketable Level 1\nequity securities(2) 4,013 0 4,013\nMutual funds Level 2 339 0 339\nGovernment bonds Level 2 1,877 440 1,437\nCorporate debt Level 2\nsecurities 3,744 65 3,679\nMortgage-backed and Level 2\nasset-backed\nsecurities 1,686 2 1,684\nTotal investments\nwith fair value\nchange recorded in\nnet income $ 18,893 $ 7,741 $ 11,152\nCash 0 8,561 0\nTotal $ 91,087 $ 77 $ (4,856) $ 105,201 $ 21,879 $ 91,883\n(1) Represents gross unrealized gains and losses for debt securities recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income\n(AOCI).\n(2) The long-term portion of marketable equity securities (subject to long-term lock-up restrictions) of $803 million as of\nDecember 31, 2022 is included within other non-current assets.\n13",

The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities\nthat have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or\nLevel 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the value based on valuation methods which may include a\ncombination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including\nvolatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. The fair value of non-marketable equity securities that\nhave been remeasured due to impairment are classified within Level 3.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $28.8 billion, of\nwhich $10.4 billion were remeasured at fair value during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and primarily\nclassified as Level 2.\n14",

Our share of gains and losses, including\nimpairments, are included as a component of OI&E, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 6 for\nfurther details on OI&E.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe use derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk\nmanaged is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows,\nearnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate\nfluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance\ninvestment returns.\nWe recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the\nderivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy\ncomprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at\ngross fair values. The accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation.\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge\ncertain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have\nmaturities of 24 months or less.\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and\nsubsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points\nand time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life\nof the hedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and\nthe amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax\neffect was $691 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.\nFair Value Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our\nmarketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in\nthe assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OI&E, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the\nrelated hedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize\nchanges in the excluded component in OI&E.\nNet Investment Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks\nrelated to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of\nhedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude\nforward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in\nOI&E.\nOther Derivatives\nWe enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to\nhedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the\nfunctional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting\nhedges are primarily recorded in OI&E along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and\nliabilities.\nWe also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates,\ncommodity prices, credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns. From time to time, we enter into derivatives\nto hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains and losses arising from other\nderivatives are primarily reflected within the \u201cother\u201d component of OI&E. See Note 6 for further details.\n17",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in\nAugust 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc.\n(\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that\nprovide enterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration\ntools; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app\npurchases, and devices.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated\nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUnaudited Interim Financial Information\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal\nrecurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of\nthe results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2024. We have made estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual\nresults could differ materially from these estimates.\nThese consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update\n(ASU) 2023-07 \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\" which expands\nannual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about\nsignificant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2024, and for\ninterim periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential\neffect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 \"Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures\" to expand the disclosure requirements for income taxes. Upon adoption we will be required to disclose\nstandardized categories in the rate reconciliation in both percentage and dollar amounts. ASU 2023-09 will also\nrequire income taxes paid to be disaggregated by jurisdiction, among other disclosure requirements. We will adopt\nASU 2023-09 for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2025.\nPrior Period Reclassifications\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.\n11",

The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities\nthat have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or\nLevel 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment\nare classified within Level 3. Our valuation methods include option pricing models, market comparable approach,\nand common stock equivalent method, which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the\ntransaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, expected time to exit, risk free rate, and the\nrights, and obligations of the securities we hold. These inputs significantly vary based on investment type.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $33.7 billion, of\nwhich $13.7 billion were remeasured at fair value during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and were\nprimarily classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy at the time of measurement.\n14",
