BUSINESS\nOverview\nAs our founders Larry and Sergey wrote in the original founders' letter, \"Google is not a conventional company.\nWe do not intend to become one.\" That unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history, inspiring\nus to tackle big problems and invest in moonshots, such as our long-term opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI). We\ncontinue this work under the leadership of Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai.\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses \u2014 the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments,\nGoogle Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Alphabet's\nstructure is about helping each of our businesses prosper through strong leaders and independence.\nAccess and technology for everyone\nThe Internet is one of the world\u2019s most powerful equalizers; it propels ideas, people and businesses large and\nsmall. Our mission to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant\ntoday as it was when we were founded in 1998. Since then, we have evolved from a company that helps people find\nanswers to a company that also helps people get things done.\nWe are focused on building an even more helpful Google for everyone, and we aspire to give everyone the tools\nthey need to increase their knowledge, health, happiness, and success. Google Search helps people find information\nand make sense of the world in more natural and intuitive ways, with trillions of searches on Google every year.\nYouTube provides people with entertainment, information, and opportunities to learn something new. Google Assistant\noffers the best way to get things done seamlessly across different devices, providing intelligent help throughout a\nperson's day, no matter where they are. Google Cloud helps customers solve today\u2019s business challenges, improve\nproductivity, reduce costs, and unlock new growth engines. We are continually innovating and building new products\nand features that will help our users, partners, customers, and communities and have invested more than $100 billion\nin research and development in the last five years in support of these efforts.\n4",

This\nincrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not\nevolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android and when we launched Chrome,\nbut those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer, popular browser.\nWe continue to look toward the future and to invest for the long term within each of our segments. As we said in the\noriginal founders' letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in, as they are the\nkey to our long-term success.\nThe power of AI\nWe believe that AI is a foundational and transformational technology that will provide compelling and helpful\nbenefits to people and society through its capacity to assist, complement, empower, and inspire people in almost every\nfield of human endeavor. As an information and computer science company, we will continue to be at the forefront of\nadvancing the frontier of AI. Through our path-breaking and field-defining research and development, we responsibly\nand boldly develop more capable and useful AI every day.\nAI already powers Google\u2019s core products that help billions of people every day and has been at the foundation of\nour core ads quality systems for years, helping large and small businesses all over the world to produce and run\neffective and efficient ad campaigns that help grow their businesses. AI makes it possible to search in new languages,\nwith multiple inputs, such as using images and text at the same time with the Google App. Some of our most popular\nproducts at Google \u2014 including Lens and Translate \u2014 were built entirely using artificial intelligence technologies such\nas optical character recognition and machine learning. Google Cloud continues to build AI into numerous solutions that\nour customers can use to develop AI-powered applications \u2014 including processing documents, images, and translation\n\u2014 to understand and analyze data more efficiently, and to use packaged solutions for a variety of industries. In all\nthese examples, AI significantly enhances the usefulness and multiplies the value of these products and services to\npeople and organizations.\nOur view is that AI is now, and more than ever, critical to delivering on our mission. As we bring our breakthrough\nAI innovations into the real world to assist people and benefit society everywhere, we are also pursuing further\nadvancements that will help to unlock scientific discoveries and to tackle humanity's greatest challenges and\nopportunities.\nPrivacy and security\nWe make it a priority to protect the privacy and security of our products, users, and customers, even if there are\nnear-term financial consequences. We do this by continuously investing in building products that are secure by default;\nstrictly upholding responsible data practices that emphasize privacy by design; and building easy-to-use settings that\nput people in control. We are continually enhancing these efforts over time, whether by enabling users to auto-delete\ntheir data, giving them new tools, such as My Ad Center, to control their ad experience, or advancing anti-malware,\nanti-phishing, and password security features.\nGoogle\nFor reporting purposes Google comprises two segments: Google Services and Google Cloud.\nGoogle Services\nServing our users\nWe have always been committed to building helpful products that can improve the lives of millions of people\nworldwide. Our product innovations are what make our services widely used, and our brand one of the most\nrecognized in the world. Google Services' core products and platforms include ads, Android, Chrome, hardware,\nGmail, Google Drive, Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Play, Search, and YouTube, with broad and growing\nadoption by users around the world.\nOur products and services have come a long way since the company was founded more than two decades ago.\nRather than the ten blue links in our early search results, users can now get direct answers to their questions using\ntheir computer or mobile device, their own voice, a photo, or an image, making it quicker, easier, and more natural to\nfind what they are looking for. Of the searches we see every day, 15% are new.\nThis drive to make information more accessible and helpful has led us over the years to improve the discovery\nand creation of digital content both on the web and through platforms like Google Play and YouTube. People are\nconsuming many forms of digital content, including watching videos, playing games, listening to music, reading books,\n5",

        "text": "Financial filing text section: Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\nWe are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions.\nOur effective tax rates are affected by a variety of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with\ndifferent statutory tax rates, net gains and losses on hedges and related transactions under our foreign exchange risk\nmanagement program, decreases in our stock price for shares issued as employee compensation, changes in the\nvaluation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, and the application of different provisions of tax laws or changes in tax\nlaws, regulations, or accounting principles (including changes in the interpretation of existing laws). Further, if we are\nunable or fail to collect taxes on behalf of customers, employees and partners as the withholding agent, we could\nbecome liable for taxes that are levied against third parties.\nWe are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. As a result, we have\nreceived, and may in the future receive, assessments in multiple jurisdictions, on various tax-related assertions, such\nas transfer-pricing adjustments or permanent-establishment claims. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit\ncould harm our financial condition and operating results, require adverse changes to our business practices, or subject\nus to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income\ntaxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and often involves uncertainty. Although we believe our\nestimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements\nand may affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nFurthermore, due to shifting economic and political conditions, tax policies, laws, or rates in various jurisdictions\nmay be subject to significant changes in ways that could harm our financial condition and operating results. Various\njurisdictions around the world have enacted or are considering revenue-based taxes such as digital services taxes and\nother targeted taxes, which could lead to inconsistent and potentially overlapping international tax regimes. The\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing\ninternational tax rules.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Stock\nWe cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program will be fully consummated or will enhance long-\nterm stockholder value, and share repurchases could increase the volatility of our stock prices and could\ndiminish our cash reserves.\nWe engage in share repurchases of our Class A and Class C stock from time to time in accordance with\nauthorizations from the Board of Directors of Alphabet. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and\ndoes not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares.\nFurther, our share repurchases could affect our share trading prices, increase their volatility, reduce our cash reserves\nand may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock.\nThe concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B stock has 10 votes per share, our Class A stock has one vote per share, and our Class C stock has\nno voting rights. As of December 31, 2022, Larry Page and Sergey Brin beneficially owned approximately 85.8% of our\noutstanding Class B stock, which represented approximately 51.2% of the voting power of our outstanding common\nstock. Through their stock ownership, Larry and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring\nstockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or\nother sale of our company or our assets, for the foreseeable future. In addition, because our Class C stock carries no\nvoting rights (except as required by applicable law), the issuance of the Class C stock, including in future stock-based\nacquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs, could continue Larry and Sergey\u2019s current\nrelative voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters\nsubmitted to a vote of our stockholders. The share repurchases made pursuant to our repurchase program may also\naffect Larry and Sergey\u2019s relative voting power. This concentrated control limits or severely restricts other stockholders\u2019\nability to influence corporate matters and we may take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial,\nwhich could reduce the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C stock.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that\nstockholders may consider favorable.\nProvisions in Alphabet\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a\nchange of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022 Our Board of Directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of\nDirectors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director.\n\u2022 Our stockholders may not act by written consent, which makes it difficult to take certain actions without holding\na stockholders' meeting.\n20",

Mandiant's financial results are reported within Google Cloud as of the\nacquisition date. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n\u2022 On July 15, 2022, the company executed a 20-for-one stock split with a record date of July 1, 2022, effected in\nthe form of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the company's Class A, Class B, and Class C\nstock. All prior period references made to share or per share amounts throughout this Management's\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations prior to the effective date have been\nretroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n\u2022 Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, we suspended the vast majority of our commercial activities in Russia\nand effectively ceased business activities of our Russian entity. The ongoing effect of these direct actions on\nour financial results was not material. The broader economic effects resulting from the war in Ukraine on our\nfuture financial results may be unpredictable.\n\u2022 Repurchases of Class A and Class C shares were $59.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. See\nNote 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form\n10-K for additional information.\n\u2022 Operating cash flow was $91.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\u2022 Capital expenditures, which primarily reflected investments in technical infrastructure, were $31.5 billion for the\nyear ended December 31, 2022.\n\u2022 As of December 31, 2022, we had 190,234 employees.\nAdditionally, looking ahead to fiscal year 2023:\n\u2022 In January 2023, we announced a reduction of our workforce of approximately 12,000 roles. We expect to\nincur employee severance and related charges of $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion, the majority of which will be\nrecognized in the first quarter of 2023.\nIn addition, we are taking actions to optimize our global office space. As a result we expect to incur exit costs\nrelating to office space reductions of approximately $0.5 billion in the first quarter of 2023. We may incur\nadditional charges in the future as we further evaluate our real estate needs.\n\u2022 In January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment,\nresulting in a change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment to six years,\nwhich we expect to result in a reduction of depreciation of approximately $3.4 billion for the full fiscal year 2023\nfor assets in service as of December 31, 2022, recorded primarily in cost of revenues and R&D expenses.\n\u2022 As AI is critical to delivering our mission of bringing our breakthrough innovations into the real world, beginning\nin January 2023, we will update our segment reporting relating to certain of Alphabet's AI activities. DeepMind,\npreviously reported within Other Bets, will be reported as part of Alphabet's corporate costs, reflecting its\nincreasing collaboration with Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets. Prior periods will be recast to\nconform to the revised presentation. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included\nin Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information relating to our segments.\n31",

In 2022, $3.2 billion of net unrealized losses were recognized on\nmarketable equity securities and $1.5 billion of net realized losses were recognized on debt securities. These losses\nwere partially offset by interest income of $2.2 billion and reversals of previously accrued performance fees related to\ncertain investments of $798 million. In 2021, $9.8 billion of net unrealized gains were recognized on non-marketable\nequity securities and $1.5 billion of interest income was recognized, partially offset by $1.9 billion of accrued\nperformance fees related to certain investments.\nSee Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form\n10-K for further information.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe following table presents provision for income taxes (in millions, except for effective tax rate):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021 2022\nIncome before provision for income taxes $ 90,734 $ 71,328\nProvision for income taxes $ 14,701 $ 11,356\nEffective tax rate 16.2 % 15.9 %\nThe effective tax rate decreased from 2021 to 2022, primarily driven by the effects of capitalization and\namortization of R&D expenses in 2022 as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act generating an increase in the\nU.S. federal Foreign Derived Intangible Income tax deduction. The decrease was partially offset by a decrease in pre-\ntax earnings, including in countries that have lower statutory rates and a decrease in the stock-based compensation\nrelated tax benefit.

As\npermitted by the Tax Act, we will pay the transition tax in annual interest-free installments through 2025. We also have\ntaxes payable of $5.1 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2022.\nPurchase Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had material non-cancelable contractual obligations of $32.0 billion, of which $17.3\nbillion was short-term. These amounts represent the non-cancelable portion of agreements or the minimum\ncancellation fee and are primarily related to commitments to purchase licenses, technical infrastructure, inventory, and\nnetwork capacity. For those agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond\nany minimum quantities and/or pricing as of December 31, 2022.\nIn addition we regularly enter into multi-year, non-cancellable agreements to purchase renewable energy and\nenergy attributes, such as renewable energy certificates. These agreements do not include a minimum dollar\ncommitment. The amounts to be paid under these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated and\nare not readily determinable.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In doing so, we have to make\nestimates and assumptions. Our critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of\nuncertainty at the time the estimate was made, and changes in them have had or are reasonably likely to have a\nmaterial effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from\nour estimates. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable\nunder the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We have reviewed our critical\naccounting estimates with the Audit and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors.\nSee Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form\n10-K for a summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements.\nFair Value Measurements of Non-Marketable Equity Securities\nWe measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, consisting primarily of our non-\nmarketable equity securities. These investments are accounted for under the measurement alternative method (\"the\nmeasurement alternative\") and are measured at cost, less impairment, subject to upward and downward adjustments\nresulting from observable price changes for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. These adjustments\nrequire quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities, which may require the use of unobservable inputs.\nPricing adjustments are determined by using various valuation methodologies and involve the use of estimates using\nthe best information available, which may include cash flow projections or other available market data.\nNon-marketable equity securities are also evaluated for impairment, based on qualitative factors including the\ncompanies' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among others. When indicators of\nimpairment exist, we prepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market\napproach or an income approach, which requires judgment and the use of unobservable inputs, including discount\nrates, investee revenues and costs, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others.\nWhen the quantitative remeasurements of fair value indicate an impairment exists, we write down the investment to its\ncurrent fair value.\nWe also have compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain investments, i.e.\nperformance fees. We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may\nresult in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use\nof unobservable inputs.\nProperty and Equipment\nWe assess the reasonableness of the useful lives of our property and equipment periodically as well as when\nother changes occur, such as when there are changes to ongoing business operations, changes in the planned use\nand utilization of assets, or technological advancements, that could indicate a change in the period over which we\nexpect to benefit from the assets.\n39",

        "text": "Financial filing text section: Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating\nour uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.\nRecording an uncertain tax position involves various qualitative considerations, including evaluation of\ncomparable and resolved tax exposures, applicability of tax laws, and likelihood of settlement. We evaluate uncertain\ntax positions periodically, considering changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial\nopinions, as well as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities. Although we believe we have adequately\nreserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not\nbe different. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such\ndifferences will affect the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination\nis made.\nThe provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are\nconsidered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties. In addition, we are subject to the continuous\nexamination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Services (IRS) and other tax authorities which may\nassert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these\nexaminations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and\nconsent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor\nand employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or\npublishers using our platforms, personal injury consumer protection, and other matters. Certain of these matters\ninclude speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe\nthat it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a\nloss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in Note 10 of\nthe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that\nhas been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make\nadjustments and changes to our disclosures as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both the\nlikelihood and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters. Until the final resolution of such matters, there\nmay be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material.\nChange in Accounting Estimate\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment, resulting\nin a change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment to six years, which we expect to\nresult in a reduction of depreciation of approximately $3.4 billion for the full fiscal year 2023 for assets in service as of\nDecember 31, 2022, recorded primarily in cost of revenues and R&D expenses. See Note 1 of the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information relating to the\nuseful lives of our servers and network equipment.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates,\nand equity investment risks.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. International revenues, as well as costs and expenses\ndenominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the\nU.S. dollar. Principal currencies hedged included the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro, and\nJapanese yen. For the purpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk, we considered the historical trends in\nforeign currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange\nrates of 10% could be experienced.\nWe use foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on assets and liabilities\ndenominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. These forward and option contracts\nreduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and\nliabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on these assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense),\nnet, which are offset by the gains and losses on the forward and option contracts.\n40",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August\n2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became\nthe successor issuer to Google.\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide\nenterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales\nof other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-\nbased products.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated\nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes.\nActual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our\nestimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; fair values of financial instruments, intangible\nassets, and goodwill; inventory; useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment; income taxes; and\ncontingent liabilities, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that\nare believed to be reasonable, and the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values\nof assets and liabilities.\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and\nadjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain\nnetwork equipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate is effective beginning in fiscal year\n2023.\nStock Split Effected in the Form of a Stock Dividend (\u201cStock Split\u201d)\nOn February 1, 2022, the company announced that the Board of Directors had approved and declared a 20-for-\none stock split in the form of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the company\u2019s Class A, Class B, and\nClass C stock. The Stock Split had a record date of July 1, 2022 and an effective date of July 15, 2022. The par value\nper share of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock remains unchanged at $0.001 per share after the Stock Split. All\nprior period references made to share or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements\nand applicable disclosures prior to the effective date have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock\nSplit.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, and\nthe collectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or services is probable. Sales and other\nsimilar taxes are excluded from revenues.\nAdvertising Revenues\nWe generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on:\n\u2022 Google Search and other properties, including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners\nwho use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated\nproperties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n\u2022 YouTube properties; and\n\u2022 Google Network properties, including revenues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob,\nAdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\nOur customers generally purchase advertising inventory through Google Ads, Google Ad Manager, and Google\nMarketing Platform, among others.\n52",

As a result, development costs\nthat meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented.\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and\ncloud-based applications used to deliver our services. We capitalize development costs related to these software\napplications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the\nsoftware will be used to perform the function intended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications\nwere not material for the periods presented.\nStock-based Compensation\nStock-based compensation primarily consists of Alphabet restricted stock units (RSUs). RSUs are equity\nclassified and measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. We recognize RSU expense\nusing the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur.\nFor RSUs, shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory income tax withholding to be\npaid by us on behalf of our employees. As a result, fewer shares are issued than the number of RSUs outstanding, and\nthe income tax withholding is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.\nAdditionally, stock-based compensation includes other stock-based awards, such as performance stock units\n(PSUs) that include market conditions and awards that may be settled in cash or the stock of certain Other Bets. PSUs\nand certain Other Bet awards are equity classified and expense is recognized over the requisite service period. Certain\nOther Bet awards are liability classified and remeasured at fair value through settlement. The fair value of Other Bet\nawards is based on the equity valuation of the respective Other Bet.\nAdvertising and Promotional Expenses\nWe expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred. For the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $5.4 billion, $7.9\nbillion, and $9.2 billion, respectively.\nPerformance Fees\nPerformance fees refer to compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain\ninvestments. We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may\nresult in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use\nof unobservable inputs. Performance fees are recorded as a component of other income (expense), net.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that\nis determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. Assets and\n54",

        "text": "Financial filing text section: Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\nNon-Income Taxes\nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The\nsubject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the\nsale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We accrue\nnon-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when\na loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of\nloss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of\nthese matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially different from our\nexpectations.\nFor information regarding income tax contingencies see Note 14.\nNote 11. Stockholders' Equity\nClass A and Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock\nOur Board of Directors has authorized three classes of stock, Class A and Class B common stock, and Class C\ncapital stock. The rights of the holders of each class of our common and capital stock are identical, except with respect\nto voting. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock\nis entitled to 10 votes per share. Class C capital stock has no voting rights, except as required by applicable law.\nShares of Class B common stock may be converted at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically\nconvert upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock.\nStock Split\nOn July 15, 2022, the company executed a 20-for-one stock split with a record date of July 1, 2022, effected in\nthe form of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the company's Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. All\nprior period references made to share or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements\nand applicable disclosures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split. See Note 1 for\nfurther details.\nShare Repurchases\nIn April 2022, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $70.0 billion of its\nClass A and Class C shares. As of December 31, 2022, $28.1 billion remains available for Class A and Class C share\nrepurchases.\nThe following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 Year Ended December 31, 2022\nShares Amount Shares Amount\nClass A share repurchases 24 $ 3,399 61 $ 6,719\nClass C share repurchases 383 46,875 469 52,577\nTotal share repurchases 407 $ 50,274 530 $ 59,296\nClass A and Class C shares are repurchased in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its\nstockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading\nprices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. Repurchases are executed from time to time, subject to\ngeneral business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or\nprivately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an\nexpiration date.\nNote 12. Net Income Per Share\nWe compute net income per share of Class A, Class B, and Class C stock using the two-class method. Basic net\nincome per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net\nincome per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutive\nsecurities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of restricted stock units and other\ncontingently issuable shares. The dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units and other contingently issuable\nshares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the\ndiluted net income per share of Class A stock assumes the conversion of Class B stock, while the diluted net income\nper share of Class B stock does not assume the conversion of those shares.\n76",

Furthermore, there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of\nincorporation, as well as Delaware law, which preclude our Board of Directors from declaring or paying unequal per\nshare dividends on our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. Specifically, Delaware law provides that amendments to\nour certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a\ngiven class of stock must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment. In\naddition, our certificate of incorporation provides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder vote, it\nmust be approved by the unanimous consent of our Board of Directors. As a result, the undistributed earnings for each\nyear are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A, Class B, and Class C stock as if the\nearnings for the year had been distributed. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed\nearnings are allocated on a proportionate basis.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022, the net income per share amounts are the same for\nClass A, Class B, and Class C stock because the holders of each class are entitled to equal per share dividends or\ndistributions in liquidation in accordance with the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Alphabet Inc.\nThe following tables set forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share of Class A, Class B, and\nClass C stock (in millions, except per share amounts):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020\nClass A Class B Class C\nBasic net income per share:\nNumerator\nAllocation of undistributed earnings $ 17,733 $ 2,732 $ 19,804\nDenominator\nNumber of shares used in per share computation 5,996 924 6,696\nBasic net income per share $ 2.96 $ 2.96 $ 2.96\nDiluted net income per share:\nNumerator\nAllocation of undistributed earnings for basic computation $ 17,733 $ 2,732 $ 19,804\nReallocation of undistributed earnings as a result of conversion of Class B to Class A\nshares 2,732 0 0\nReallocation of undistributed earnings (180) (25) 180\nAllocation of undistributed earnings $ 20,285 $ 2,707 $ 19,984\nDenominator\nNumber of shares used in basic computation 5,996 924 6,696\nWeighted-average effect of dilutive securities\nAdd:\nConversion of Class B to Class A shares outstanding 924 0 0\nRestricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares 2 0 123\nNumber of shares used in per share computation 6,922 924 6,819\nDiluted net income per share $ 2.93 $ 2.93 $ 2.93\n77",

Compensation Plans\nStock Plans\nOur stock plans include the Alphabet Amended and Restated 2021 Stock Plan (\"Alphabet 2021 Stock Plan\") and\nOther Bet stock-based plans. Under our stock plans, RSUs and other types of awards may be granted. Under the\nAlphabet 2021 Stock Plan, an RSU award is an agreement to issue shares of our Class C stock at the time the award\nvests. RSUs generally vest over four years contingent upon employment on the vesting date.\nAs of December 31, 2022, there were 706 million shares of Class C stock reserved for future issuance under the\nAlphabet 2021 Stock Plan.\nStock-Based Compensation\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022, total stock-based compensation expense was $13.4\nbillion, $15.7 billion, and $19.5 billion, including amounts associated with awards we expect to settle in Alphabet stock\nof $12.8 billion, $15.0 billion, and $18.8 billion, respectively.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022, we recognized tax benefits on total stock-based\ncompensation expense, which are reflected in the provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of\nIncome, of $2.7 billion, $3.1 billion, and $3.9 billion, respectively.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022, tax benefit realized related to awards vested or\nexercised during the period was $3.6 billion, $5.9 billion, and $4.7 billion, respectively.

        "text": "Financial filing text section: Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to our gross unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2021 2022\nBeginning gross unrecognized tax benefits $ 3,377 $ 3,837 $ 5,158\nIncreases related to prior year tax positions 372 529 253\nDecreases related to prior year tax positions (557) (263) (437)\nDecreases related to settlement with tax authorities (45) (329) (140)\nIncreases related to current year tax positions 690 1,384 2,221\nEnding gross unrecognized tax benefits $ 3,837 $ 5,158 $ 7,055\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating\nour uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. The total amount of gross unrecognized tax\nbenefits was $3.8 billion, $5.2 billion, and $7.1 billion as of December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively, of which\n$2.6 billion, $3.7 billion, and $5.3 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2022, we accrued $270 million and $346 million in interest and penalties in\nprovision for income taxes, respectively.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. Our two\nmajor tax jurisdictions are the U.S. federal and Ireland. We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax\nreturns by the IRS and other tax authorities. The IRS is currently examining our 2016 through 2018 tax returns. We\nhave also received tax assessments in multiple foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or\npermanent establishment. We continue to defend any and all such claims as presented.\nThe tax years 2015 through 2021 remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for\nIrish tax purposes. There are other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial\nstatements.\nWe regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the\nadequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax\nauthorities and the effect, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions.\nWe believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.\nHowever, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are\nresolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for\nincome taxes in the period such resolutions occur. Although the timing of resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is\nnot certain, it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits from certain U.S. federal, state, and non U.S.\ntax positions could decrease by approximately $1.8 billion in the next 12 months. Positions that may be resolved\ninclude various U.S. and non-U.S. matters.\nNote 15. Information about Segments and Geographic Areas\nWe report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:\n\u2022 Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Google Maps,\nGoogle Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales of\napps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products such as\nYouTube Premium and YouTube TV.\n\u2022 Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for\nenterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues from fees received for Google Cloud Platform\nservices, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\n\u2022 Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from\nOther Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\nRevenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering\nactivities, and hardware, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the\nintegrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are\nmanaged centrally at a consolidated level. The associated costs, including depreciation and impairment, are allocated\nto operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage or headcount.\n82",

With Performance Max, advertisers simply tell us their campaign\ngoals and share their creative assets, and AI will automatically produce and run a highly effective ad campaign across\nall of Google\u2019s properties, to meet their budget. Product Studio brings the benefits of AI to businesses of all sizes,\nhelping them easily create uniquely-tailored imagery featuring their products \u2014 for free. Additionally, we are\nexperimenting with Search and Shopping ads that are directly integrated into the AI-powered snapshot and\nconversational mode in Search Generative Experience.\nBuild the Most Helpful Personal Computing Platforms and Devices\nOver the years, our Pixel phones have incorporated AI compute directly into the device and built experiences on\ntop of it. Our latest Pixel devices were built around AI, bringing the best AI-assistive experiences to our users, such as\nBest Take, Magic Editor, and Audio Magic Eraser. As we look ahead, we are designing our Android and Chrome\noperating systems with new AI-forward user experiences.\nMoonshots\nMany companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This\nincrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not\nevolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android and when we launched Chrome,\nbut those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer, popular browser.\nOur early investments in AI started out as moonshots but are now incorporated into our core products and central to\nfuture developments. We continue to look toward the future and to invest for the long term, most notably for the\napplication of AI to our products and services, as well as other frontier technologies such as quantum computing. As\nwe said in the original founders' letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in, as\nthey are the key to our long-term success.\nPrivacy and Security\nWe make it a priority to protect the privacy and security of our products, users, and customers, even if there are\nnear-term financial consequences. We do this by continuously investing in building products that are secure by default;\nstrictly upholding responsible data practices that emphasize privacy by design; and building easy-to-use settings that\nput people in control. We are continually enhancing these efforts over time, whether by enabling users to auto-delete\ntheir data, giving them tools, such as My Ad Center, to control their ad experience, or advancing anti-malware, anti-\nphishing, and password security features.\nGoogle\nFor reporting purposes Google comprises two segments: Google Services and Google Cloud.\nGoogle Services\nServing Our Users\nWe have always been committed to building helpful products that can improve the lives of millions of people\nworldwide. Our product innovations are what make our services widely used, and our brand one of the most\nrecognized in the world. Google Services' core products and platforms include ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Gmail,\nGoogle Drive, Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Play, Search, and YouTube, with broad and growing adoption by\nusers around the world.\nOur products and services have come a long way since the company was founded more than 25 years ago.\nWhile Google Search started as a way to find web pages, organized into ten blue links, we have driven technical\nadvancements and product innovations that have transformed Google Search into a dynamic, multimodal experience.\nWe first expanded from traditional desktop browsers into mobile web search, making it easier to navigate on smaller\nscreens. As new types of content surfaced on the internet, Universal Search made it possible to search multiple\ncontent types, like news, images, videos, and more, to deliver rich, relevant results. The introduction of new search\nmodalities, like voice and visual search, made it easier for people to express their curiosity in natural and intuitive\nways. We took that a step further with multisearch, which lets people search with text and images at the same time.\nLarge language models like BERT and Multitask Unified Models, or MUMs, have made it possible to express more\nnatural language queries, vastly improving the quality of results. Each advancement has made it easier and more\nnatural for people to find what they are looking for.\nThis drive to make information more accessible and helpful has led us over the years to improve the discovery\nand creation of digital content both on the web and through platforms like Google Play and YouTube. People are\nconsuming many forms of digital content, including watching videos, streaming TV, playing games, listening to music,\n6.",

As a result, we have\nreceived, and may in the future receive, assessments in multiple jurisdictions, on various tax-related assertions, such\nas transfer-pricing adjustments or permanent-establishment claims. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit\ncould harm our financial condition and operating results, require adverse changes to our business practices, or subject\nus to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income\ntaxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and often involves uncertainty. Although we believe our\nestimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements\nand may affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nFurthermore, due to shifting economic and political conditions, tax policies, laws, or rates in various jurisdictions\nmay be subject to significant changes in ways that could harm our financial condition and operating results. For\nexample, various jurisdictions around the world have enacted or are considering revenue-based taxes such as digital\nservices taxes and other targeted taxes, which could lead to inconsistent and potentially overlapping international tax\nregimes. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is coordinating negotiations among\nmore than 140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus around substantial changes to international tax policies,\nincluding the implementation of a minimum global effective tax rate of 15%. Our effective tax rate and cash tax\npayments could increase in future years as a result of these changes.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Stock\nWe cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program will be fully consummated or will enhance long-\nterm stockholder value, and share repurchases could increase the volatility of our stock prices and could\ndiminish our cash reserves.\nWe engage in share repurchases of our Class A and Class C stock from time to time in accordance with\nauthorizations from the Board of Directors of Alphabet. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and\ndoes not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares.\nFurther, our share repurchases could affect our share trading prices, increase their volatility, reduce our cash reserves\nand may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock.\nThe concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B stock has 10 votes per share, our Class A stock has one vote per share, and our Class C stock has\nno voting rights. As of December 31, 2023, Larry Page and Sergey Brin beneficially owned approximately 86.5% of our\noutstanding Class B stock, which represented approximately 51.5% of the voting power of our outstanding common\nstock. Through their stock ownership, Larry and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring\nstockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or\nother sale of our company or our assets, for the foreseeable future. In addition, because our Class C stock carries no\nvoting rights (except as required by applicable law), the issuance of the Class C stock, including in future stock-based\nacquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs, could continue Larry and Sergey\u2019s current\nrelative voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters\nsubmitted to a vote of our stockholders. The share repurchases made pursuant to our repurchase program may also\naffect Larry and Sergey\u2019s relative voting power. This concentrated control limits or severely restricts other stockholders\u2019\nability to influence corporate matters and we may take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial,\nwhich could reduce the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C stock.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that\nstockholders may consider favorable.\nProvisions in Alphabet\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a\nchange of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022 Our Board of Directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of\nDirectors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director.\n\u2022 Our stockholders may not act by written consent, which makes it difficult to take certain actions without holding\na stockholders' meeting.\n\u2022 Our certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of\nminority stockholders to elect director candidates.\n22.",

A cumulative one-time adjustment applicable\nto the prior period for these tax rule changes was recorded in 2023.\nThe effective tax rate decreased from 2022 to 2023, reflecting the effect of the two tax rule changes described\nabove, particularly the change related to foreign tax credits. The effect of these tax rule changes was partially offset by\nchanges in uncertain tax benefits and a decrease in the U.S. federal Foreign Derived Intangible Income tax deduction.\nThe OECD is coordinating negotiations among more than 140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus\naround substantial changes to international tax policies, including the implementation of a minimum global effective tax\nrate of 15%. While various countries have implemented the legislation as of January 1, 2024, we do not expect a\nresulting material change to our income tax provision for the 2024 fiscal year.

        "text": "Financial filing text section: Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\nEuropean Commission Fines\nIn 2017, 2018 and 2019, the EC announced decisions that certain actions taken by Google infringed European\ncompetition law and imposed fines of \u20ac2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017), \u20ac4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of\nJune 30, 2018), and \u20ac1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019), respectively. On September 14, 2022, the General\nCourt reduced the 2018 fine from \u20ac4.3 billion to \u20ac4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal to the European Court of\nJustice.\nWhile each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities\non our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines. For\nadditional information, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.\nTaxes\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had income taxes payable of $4.2 billion, of which $2.1 billion was short-term,\nrelated to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\"). As\npermitted by the Tax Act, we will pay the transition tax in annual interest-free installments through 2025. We also have\nlong-term taxes payable of $6.3 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2023.\nPurchase Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had material purchase commitments and other contractual obligations of $45.9\nbillion, of which $31.6 billion was short-term. These amounts primarily consist of purchase orders for certain technical\ninfrastructure as well as the non-cancelable portion or the minimum cancellation fee in certain agreements related to\ncommitments to purchase licenses, including content licenses, inventory and network capacity. For those agreements\nwith variable terms, we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as\nof December 31, 2023. In certain instances, the amount of our contractual obligations may change based on the\nexpected timing of order fulfillment from our suppliers. For more information related to our content licenses, see Note\n10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition, we regularly enter into multi-year, non-cancellable agreements to purchase renewable energy and\nenergy attributes, such as renewable energy certificates. These agreements do not include a minimum dollar\ncommitment. The amounts to be paid under these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated and\nare not readily determinable.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In doing so, we have to make\nestimates and assumptions. Our critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of\nuncertainty at the time the estimate was made, and changes in them have had or are reasonably likely to have a\nmaterial effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from\nour estimates. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable\nunder the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We have reviewed our critical\naccounting estimates with the Audit and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors.\nFor a summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements, see Note 1 of the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFair Value Measurements of Non-Marketable Equity Securities\nWe measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, consisting primarily of our non-\nmarketable equity securities. These investments are accounted for under the measurement alternative method (\"the\nmeasurement alternative\") and are measured at cost, less impairment, subject to upward and downward adjustments\nresulting from observable price changes for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. These adjustments\nrequire quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities, which may require the use of unobservable inputs.\nAdjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date and involve the use of\nestimates using the best information available, which may include cash flow projections or other available market data.\nNon-marketable equity securities are also evaluated for impairment, based on qualitative factors including the\ncompanies' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among others. When indicators of\nimpairment exist, we prepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market\napproach or an income approach, which requires judgment and the use of unobservable inputs, including discount\nrates, investee revenues and costs, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others.\n43.",

We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may\nresult in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use\nof unobservable inputs.\nProperty and Equipment\nWe assess the reasonableness of the useful lives of our property and equipment periodically as well as when\nother changes occur, such as when there are changes to ongoing business operations, changes in the planned use\nand utilization of assets, or technological advancements, that could indicate a change in the period over which we\nexpect to benefit from the assets.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating\nour uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.\nRecording an uncertain tax position involves various qualitative considerations, including evaluation of\ncomparable and resolved tax exposures, applicability of tax laws, and likelihood of settlement. We evaluate uncertain\ntax positions periodically, considering changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial\nopinions, as well as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities. Although we believe we have adequately\nreserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not\nbe different. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such\ndifferences will affect the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination\nis made.\nThe provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the\nrelated net interest and penalties. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns\nby the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of\nadverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for\nincome taxes.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and\nconsent orders involving competition, intellectual property, privacy, data security, tax and related compliance, labor and\nemployment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or\npublishers using our platforms, personal injury consumer protection, and other matters. Certain of these matters\ninclude speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe\nthat it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a\nloss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in Note 10 of\nthe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that\nhas been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make\nadjustments and changes to our disclosures. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood and the\nestimated amount of a loss related to such matters. Until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an\nexposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material.\nChange in Accounting Estimate\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment resulting\nin a change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment to six years. This change in\naccounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023. For additional information, see Note 1 of the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n44.",

As a result, development costs\nthat meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented.\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and\ncloud-based applications used to deliver our services. We capitalize development costs related to these software\napplications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the\nsoftware will be used to perform the function intended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications\nwere not material for the periods presented.\nStock-based Compensation\nStock-based compensation (SBC) primarily consists of Alphabet restricted stock units (RSUs). RSUs are equity\nclassified and measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. We recognize RSU expense\nusing the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur.\nFor RSUs, shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory income tax withholding to be\npaid by us on behalf of our employees. As a result, fewer shares are issued than the number of RSUs outstanding, and\nthe income tax withholding is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.\nAdditionally, SBC includes other stock-based awards, such as performance stock units (PSUs) that include\nmarket conditions and awards that may be settled in cash or the stock of certain Other Bet companies. PSUs and\ncertain awards granted by Other Bet companies are equity classified and expense is recognized over the requisite\nservice period. Certain awards granted by Other Bet companies are liability classified and remeasured at fair value\nthrough settlement. The fair value of awards granted by Other Bet companies is based on the equity valuation of the\nrespective Other Bet company.\nAdvertising and Promotional Expenses\nWe expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred. For the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $7.9 billion, $9.2\nbillion, and $8.7 billion, respectively.\nPerformance Fees\nPerformance fees refer to compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain\ninvestments. We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may\nresult in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use\nof unobservable inputs. Performance fees are recorded as a component of OI&E.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that\nis determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. Assets and\nliabilities recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with a three-tier fair value hierarchy based\non the observability of the inputs available in the market used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active\nmarkets.\n58.",

Under our stock plans, RSUs and other types of awards may be granted. Under the\nAlphabet 2021 Stock Plan, an RSU award is an agreement to issue shares of our Class C stock at the time the award\nvests. RSUs generally vest over four years contingent upon employment on the vesting date.\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were 723 million shares of Class C stock reserved for future issuance under the\nAlphabet 2021 Stock Plan.\nStock-Based Compensation\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023, total SBC expense was $15.7 billion, $19.5 billion, and\n$22.1 billion, including amounts associated with awards we expect to settle in Alphabet stock of $15.0 billion, $18.8\nbillion, and $21.7 billion, respectively.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, total SBC expense includes $432 million associated with workforce\nreduction costs. See Note 8 for further details.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023, we recognized tax benefits on total SBC expense,\nwhich are reflected in the provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income, of $3.1 billion, $3.9\nbillion, and $4.5 billion, respectively.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023, tax benefit realized related to awards vested or\nexercised during the period was $5.9 billion, $4.7 billion, and $5.6 billion, respectively. These amounts do not include\nthe indirect effects of stock-based awards, which primarily relate to the R&D tax credit.\nStock-Based Award Activities\n82.",

For example, advertisers are able to use our updated image generation in Google Ads\nto produce high-quality imagery for their campaigns, and Demand Gen helps them reach their target audiences.\nBuild the Most Helpful Personal Computing Platforms and Devices\nOver the years, our Pixel phones have incorporated AI compute directly into the device and built experiences on\ntop of it. Our latest Pixel devices were built with Gemini Nano, bringing the best AI-assistive experiences to our users,\nsuch as Gemini on Pixel, Pixel Screenshots, and Pixel Studio. Our Android and Chrome operating systems enable\nusers to access Gemini, and other Google AI features throughout their day. For example, with Circle to Search built\ndirectly into the Android experience, users can search anything they see on their phone using a simple gesture.\nMoonshots\nMany companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This\nincrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not\nevolutionary. Our acquisitions of YouTube and Android and subsequent launch of Chrome have matured into major\nplatforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer, popular browser. In Other Bets, our fully autonomous driving\ntechnology company, Waymo, is now providing fully autonomous, paid ride-hailing services to customers in multiple\ncities.\nOur early investments in AI started out as moonshots but are now incorporated into our core products and central\nto future developments. We continue to look toward the future and to invest for the long term, most notably for the\napplication of AI to our products and services, as well as other frontier technologies such as quantum computing. As\nwe said in the original founders' letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in, as\nthey are the key to our long-term success.\nPrivacy and Security\nWe make it a priority to protect the privacy and security of our products, users, and customers, even if there are\nnear-term financial consequences. We do this by continuously investing in building products that are secure by default;\nstrictly upholding responsible data practices that emphasize privacy by design; and building easy-to-use settings that\nput people in control. We are continually enhancing these efforts over time, whether by enabling users to auto-delete\ntheir data, applying privacy technologies like on-device processing, giving people tools to control their experience, or\nadvancing anti-malware, anti-phishing, and password security features.\nGoogle\nFor reporting purposes Google comprises two segments: Google Services and Google Cloud.\nGoogle Services\nServing Our Users\nWe have always been committed to building helpful products that can improve the lives of millions of people\nworldwide. Our product innovations are what make our services widely used, and our brand one of the most\nrecognized in the world. Google Services' core products and platforms include ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Gmail,\nGoogle Drive, Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Play, Search, and YouTube, with broad and growing adoption by\nusers around the world.\nOur products and services have come a long way since the company was founded more than 25 years ago.\nWhile Google Search started as a way to find web pages, organized into ten blue links, we have driven technical\nadvancements and product innovations that have transformed Google Search into a dynamic, multimodal experience.\nWe first expanded from traditional desktop browsers into mobile web search, making it easier to navigate on smaller\nscreens. As new types of content surfaced on the internet, Universal Search made it possible to search multiple\ncontent types, like news, images, videos, and more, to deliver rich, relevant results. The introduction of new search\nmodalities, like voice and visual search, made it easier for people to express their curiosity in natural and intuitive\nways. We took that a step further with multisearch, which lets people search with text and images at the same time.\nLarge language models have made it possible to express more natural language queries, vastly improving the types of\nquestions users can ask, and the quality of results. Each advancement has made it easier and more natural for people\nto find what they are looking for. We are now using Gemini customized for Google Search to provide our users an\nimproved Search experience, and AI Overviews has been released in more than one hundred countries, reaching more\nthan one billion users.\nThis drive to make information more accessible and helpful has led us over the years to improve the discovery\nand creation of digital content both on the web and through platforms like Google Play and YouTube. People are\nconsuming many forms of digital content, including watching videos, streaming TV, playing games, listening to music,\n6.",

The U.S. has imposed a 1% excise tax on the fair market value of shares repurchased, which could\npotentially increase in the future. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is\ncoordinating negotiations among more than 140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus around substantial\nchanges to international tax policies, including the implementation of a minimum global effective tax rate of 15%, on\nwhich various jurisdictions around the world have either introduced draft legislation or adopted final legislation. Our\neffective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase as a result of these changes.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Stock\nWe cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program or dividend program will be continuously active\nor fully consummated or will enhance long-term stockholder value, and share repurchases or dividends could\nincrease the volatility of our stock prices and could diminish our cash reserves.\nWe engage in share repurchases of our Class A and Class C stock from time to time in accordance with\nauthorizations from the Board of Directors of Alphabet. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and\ndoes not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. In\nApril 2024, we announced the approval of our cash dividend program and began paying regular cash dividends to our\nClass A, Class B, and Class C stockholders. Any and all future cash dividends are subject to declaration by our Board\nof Directors in its sole discretion, and in accordance with the requirements of any applicable laws, rules, and\nregulations, including the Delaware General Corporation Law. Our cash dividend program does not require, and our\nBoard of Directors may decide not to declare, a cash dividend each quarter, and does not obligate our Board of\nDirectors to declare a dividend at any specific dollar amount per share. Any such decision by our Board of Directors\nmay depend on a variety of factors that it may deem relevant, including but not limited to our earnings, liquidity,\nfinancial condition, other capital deployment opportunities, level of indebtedness, and general market conditions. Our\nshare repurchases or dividends could affect our share trading prices, increase their volatility, reduce our cash reserves\nand may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock.\nThe concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B stock has 10 votes per share, our Class A stock has one vote per share, and our Class C stock has\nno voting rights. As of December 31, 2024, Larry Page and Sergey Brin beneficially owned approximately 87.4% of our\noutstanding Class B stock, which represented approximately 52.1% of the voting power of our outstanding common\nstock. Through their stock ownership, Larry and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring\nstockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or\nother sale of our company or our assets, for the foreseeable future. In addition, because our Class C stock carries no\nvoting rights (except as required by applicable law), the issuance of the Class C stock, including in future stock-based\nacquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs, could continue Larry and Sergey\u2019s current\nrelative voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters\nsubmitted to a vote of our stockholders. The share repurchases made pursuant to our repurchase program may also\naffect Larry and Sergey\u2019s relative voting power. This concentrated control limits or severely restricts other stockholders\u2019\nability to influence corporate matters and we may take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial,\nwhich could reduce the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C stock.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that\nstockholders may consider favorable.\nProvisions in Alphabet\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a\nchange of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022 Our Board of Directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of\nDirectors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director.\n\u2022 Our stockholders may not act by written consent, which makes it difficult to take certain actions without holding\na stockholders' meeting.\n\u2022 Our certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of\nminority stockholders to elect director candidates.\n\u2022 Stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the Board of Directors or to\npropose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter\na potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer's own slate of directors or\notherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.\n23.",

These increases were\npartially offset by reductions in charges related to legal and other matters and charges related to our office\nspace optimization efforts. The overall increase in employee compensation expenses was partially offset by a\nreduction in employee severance and related charges.\nOther Information:\n\u2022 Dividend payments to stockholders of Class A, Class B, and Class C shares, which were first paid in June\n2024, were $3.5 billion, $519 million, and $3.3 billion, respectively, totaling $7.4 billion for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2024.

In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns\nby the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of\nadverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for\nincome taxes.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and investigations, other proceedings,\nand consent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance,\nlabor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by\nadvertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. Certain of these\nmatters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we\nbelieve that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine\nthat a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in Note\n10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that\nhas been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make\nadjustments and changes to our disclosures. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood and the\nestimated amount of a loss related to such matters. Until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an\nexposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates,\nand equity investment risks.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. International revenues, as well as costs and expenses\ndenominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the\nU.S. dollar. As discussed below, we enter into derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency risk. Principal\ncurrencies hedged included the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro, and Japanese yen. For the\npurpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk, we considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange\nrates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% could be\nexperienced.\nWe use foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on monetary assets and\nliabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. These forward and option\ncontracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets\nand liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on these assets and liabilities are recorded in OI&E, which are\noffset by the gains and losses on the forward and option contracts.\nIf an adverse 10% foreign currency exchange rate change was applied to net monetary assets, liabilities, and\ncommitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies at the balance sheet date, it would have\nresulted in an adverse effect on income before income taxes of approximately $503 million and $135 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively, after consideration of the effect of foreign exchange contracts in place for\nthe years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024.\nWe use foreign currency forward and option contracts, including collars (an option strategy comprised of a\ncombination of purchased and written options) to protect forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from changes in\nforeign currency exchange rates. When the U.S. dollar strengthens, gains from foreign currency forward and option\ncontacts reduce the foreign currency losses related to our earnings. When the U.S. dollar weakens, losses from foreign\ncurrency forward and option contracts offset the foreign currency gains related to our earnings. These hedging\ncontracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We designate\nthese contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. We reflect the gains and losses of foreign currency spot\nrate changes as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and subsequently reclassify them\ninto revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur.\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10% as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, the amount recorded in AOCI related to\nour cash flow hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion lower as of\n45.",

In addition, global economic conditions\ncould result in additional volatility. The success of our investment in any private company is also typically dependent on\nthe likelihood of our ability to realize appreciation in the value of investments through liquidity events such as public\nofferings, acquisitions, private sales or other market events. Changes in the valuation of non-marketable equity\nsecurities may not directly correlate with changes in valuation of marketable equity securities. As of December 31,\n2023 and 2024, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities, which were accounted for under the\nmeasurement alternative, was $28.8 billion and $35.5 billion, respectively.\nThe carrying values of our equity method investments, which totaled approximately $1.7 billion and $2.0 billion as\nof December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively, generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes. However,\nthese investments could be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value and is not expected to recover.\nFor additional information about our equity investments, see Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n47.",

As a result, development costs\nthat meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented.\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and\ncloud-based applications used to deliver our services. We capitalize development costs related to these software\napplications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the\nsoftware will be used to perform the function intended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications\nwere not material for the periods presented.\nStock-based Compensation\nStock-based compensation (SBC) primarily consists of Alphabet restricted stock units (RSUs). RSUs are equity\nclassified and measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. We recognize RSU expense\nusing the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur.\nRSUs are awarded dividend equivalents, which are subject to the same vesting conditions as the underlying award,\nand settled in Class C shares.\nFor RSUs, shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory income tax withholding to be\npaid by us on behalf of our employees. As a result, fewer shares are issued than the number of RSUs outstanding, and\nthe income tax withholding is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.\nAdditionally, SBC includes other stock-based awards, such as performance stock units (PSUs) that include\nmarket conditions and awards that may be settled in cash or the stock of certain Other Bet companies. PSUs and\ncertain awards granted by Other Bet companies are equity classified and expense is recognized over the requisite\nservice period. Certain awards granted by Other Bet companies are liability classified and remeasured at fair value\nthrough settlement. The fair value of awards granted by Other Bet companies is based on the equity valuation of the\nrespective Other Bet company.\nAdvertising and Promotional Expenses\nWe expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred. For the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $9.2 billion, $8.7\nbillion, and $8.7 billion, respectively.\nPerformance Fees\nPerformance fees refer to compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain\ninvestments. We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may\nresult in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use\nof unobservable inputs. Performance fees are recorded as a component of OI&E.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured\nand classified in accordance with a three-tier fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the inputs available in\nthe market used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active\nmarkets.\nLevel 2 - Inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for\nidentical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all\nsignificant inputs are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data.

We measure recoverability of these assets by\ncomparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected\nto generate. If the carrying value of the assets or asset group is not recoverable, the impairment recognized is\nmeasured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which we recognize the amount of taxes\npayable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of\nevents that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We measure current and deferred tax\nassets and liabilities based on provisions of enacted tax law. We evaluate the likelihood of future realization of our\ndeferred tax assets based on all available evidence and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets\nwhen it is more likely than not that they will not be realized or release a valuation allowance to increase deferred tax\nassets when it is more likely than not that they will be realized. We have elected to account for the tax effects of the\nglobal intangible low tax income provision as a current period expense.\nWe recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that, based on\ntechnical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The tax benefits of the position recognized in the\nfinancial statements are then measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be\nrealized upon settlement with a taxing authority. In addition, we recognize interest and penalties related to\nunrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the acquisition date. We allocate the\npurchase price of the acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values,\nexcept for revenue contracts acquired, which are recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The\nexcess of the purchase price over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\nForeign Currency\nWe translate the financial statements of our international subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange\nrates for assets and liabilities, and average rates for the period derived from month-end exchange rates for revenues,\ncosts, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in AOCI as a component of stockholders\u2019 equity. We\nreflect net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction currency to\nfunctional currency as a component of foreign currency exchange gain (loss) in OI&E.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update\n(ASU) 2023-09 \"Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\" to expand the disclosure\nrequirements for income taxes. Upon adoption we will be required to disclose additional specified categories in the rate\nreconciliation in both percentage and dollar amounts. We will also be required to disclose the amount of income taxes\npaid disaggregated by jurisdiction, among other disclosure requirements. The standard can be applied either\nprospectively or retrospectively. We will adopt the standard in our 2025 annual period and are currently assessing the\neffect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03 \"Income Statement: Reporting Comprehensive Income-\nExpense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40)\" to improve the disclosures about an entity\u2019s expenses. Upon\nadoption, we will be required to disclose in the notes to the financial statements a disaggregation of certain expense\ncategories included within the expense captions on the face of the income statement. The standard is effective for our\n2027 annual period, and our interim periods beginning in 2028, with early adoption permitted. The standard can be\napplied either prospectively or retrospectively. We are currently assessing adoption timing and the effect that the\nupdated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07 \u201cSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to\nReportable Segment Disclosures\u201d which expands annual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments,\nprimarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. We adopted this ASU for our 2024 annual\nperiod with the comparative periods updated to reflect additional disclosures. See Note 15 for further details.\nPrior Period Reclassifications\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.\n63.",

If not utilized, the federal net\noperating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2025, foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in\n2025 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2033. It is more likely than not that the\nmajority of the net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized. The net operating loss carryforwards are subject to\nvarious annual limitations under the tax laws of the different jurisdictions.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our Federal and California research and development credit carryforwards for income\ntax purposes were approximately $700 million and $6.4 billion, respectively. If not utilized, the Federal R&D credit will\nbegin to expire in 2037 and the California R&D credit can be carried over indefinitely. We believe the majority of the\nfederal tax credit and state tax credit is not likely to be realized.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our investment tax credit carryforwards for state income tax purposes were\napproximately $1.2 billion and will begin to expire in 2030. We use the flow-through method of accounting for\ninvestment tax credits. We believe this tax credit is not likely to be realized.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we maintained a valuation allowance with respect to California deferred tax assets,\ncertain federal net operating losses, certain state net operating losses and tax credits, net deferred tax assets relating\nto Other Bet companies, and certain foreign net operating losses that we believe are not likely to be realized. We\ncontinue to reassess the remaining valuation allowance quarterly, and if future evidence allows for a partial or full\nrelease of the valuation allowance, a tax benefit will be recorded accordingly.\nCash paid for income taxes, net of refunds, was $18.9 billion, $19.2 billion, and $27.4 billion as of December 31,\n2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively.\n86.",

Significant judgment is required in evaluating\nour uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. The total amount of gross unrecognized tax\nbenefits was $7.1 billion, $9.4 billion, and $12.6 billion as of December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively, of\nwhich $5.3 billion, $7.4 billion, and $10.0 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2024, we accrued $622 million and $1.1 billion in interest and penalties in provision\nfor income taxes, respectively.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. Our two\nmajor tax jurisdictions are the U.S. federal and Ireland. We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax\nreturns by the IRS and other tax authorities. The IRS is currently examining our 2016 through 2021 tax returns. We\nhave also received tax assessments in multiple foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or\npermanent establishment. We continue to defend such claims as presented.\nThe tax years 2016 through 2023 remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for\nIrish tax purposes. There are other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial\nstatements.\nWe regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the\nadequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax\nauthorities and the effect, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions.\nWe believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.\nHowever, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are\nresolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for\nincome taxes in the period such resolutions occur. Although the timing of resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is\nnot certain, we do not believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits from certain U.S. federal,\nstate, and non U.S. tax positions will materially change in the next 12 months.\nNote 15. Information about Segments and Geographic Areas\nWe report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:\n\u2022 Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Google Maps,\nGoogle Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; fees\nreceived for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and\nNFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One; the sale of apps and in-app purchases; and devices.\n\u2022 Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, applications, and other services for enterprise\ncustomers. Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from consumption-based fees and subscriptions\nreceived for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and\nother enterprise services.\n\u2022 Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from\nOther Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.\nRevenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering\nactivities, and devices, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the\nintegrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are\nmanaged centrally at a consolidated level. These costs, including the associated depreciation, are allocated to\noperating segments as a service cost generally based on usage, headcount, or revenue.\n87.",

        "text": "Financial filing text section: Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\nNon-Income Taxes\nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters.\nThe subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied\nto the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We\naccrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax\nauthorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and\nthe loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity\nand uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially\ndifferent from our expectations.\nFor information regarding income tax contingencies, see Note 13.\nNote 10. Stockholders' Equity\nShare Repurchases\nIn April 2021, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $50.0 billion of its\nClass C stock. In July 2021, the Board of Directors of Alphabet approved an amendment to the April 2021\nauthorization, permitting the company to repurchase both Class A and Class C shares in a manner deemed in the\nbest interest of the company and its stockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market\nconditions, including the relative trading prices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. As of March 31,\n2022, $4.1 billion remains available for Class A and Class C share repurchases under the amended authorization.\nIn accordance with the authorizations of the Board of Directors of Alphabet, during the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2022, we repurchased and subsequently retired 4.9 million aggregate shares for $13.3 billion. Of the\naggregate amount repurchased and subsequently retired during the three months ended March 31, 2022, 0.2\nmillion shares were Class A stock for $660 million and 4.7 million shares were Class C stock for $12.6 billion.\nIn April 2022, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional\n$70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its\nstockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading\nprices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares.\nRepurchases are executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other\ninvestment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through\nRule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date.\nStock Split Effected in Form of Stock Dividend (\u201cStock Split\u201d)\nOn February 1, 2022, the company announced that the Board of Directors had approved and declared a 20-\nfor-one stock split in the form of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the company\u2019s Class A, Class\nB, and Class C stock. The Stock Split is subject to stockholder approval of an amendment to the company\u2019s\nAmended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Class A, Class\nB, and Class C stock to accommodate the Stock Split.\nIf approval is obtained, each of the company\u2019s stockholders of record at the close of business on July 1, 2022\n(the \u201cRecord Date\u201d), will receive, after the close of business on July 15, 2022, a dividend of 19 additional shares of\nthe same class of stock for every share held by such stockholder as of the Record Date.\n26",

The decrease was primarily due to a benefit driven by the effects of capitalization and\namortization of research and development expenses starting in 2022 as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\ngenerating an increase in the U.S. federal Foreign-Derived Intangible Income tax deduction.\nFinancial Condition\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities\nAs of March 31, 2022, we had $134.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities.\nCash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly liquid\ngovernment bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities and marketable equity\nsecurities.\nSources, Uses of Cash and Related Trends\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash\nflow that we generate from operations. The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long-term growth\nof the business. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace and form of capital\nreturn to stockholders.\nThe following table presents our cash flows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2021 2022\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 19,289 $ 25,106\nNet cash used in investing activities $ (5,383) $ (9,051)\nNet cash used in financing activities $ (13,606) $ (16,214)\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nOur largest source of cash provided by operations are advertising revenues generated by Google Search &\nother properties, Google Network properties and YouTube ads. Additionally, we generate cash through sales of apps\nand in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees including fees\nreceived for Google Cloud offerings and subscription-based products.\nOur primary uses of cash from our operating activities include payments to distribution and Google Network\npartners, for compensation and related costs, and for content acquisition costs. In addition, uses of cash from\noperating activities include hardware inventory costs, income taxes, and other general corporate expenditures.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased from the three months ended March 31, 2021 to the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2022 primarily due to the net effect of an increase in cash received from revenues and\ncash paid for cost of revenues and operating expenses, and changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nCash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of investments in marketable\nand non-marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of marketable and\nnon-marketable securities, purchases of property and equipment, and payments for acquisitions.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased from the three months ended March 31, 2021 to the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2022 primarily due to an increase of purchases of property and equipment, partially offset\n39",

Our investor relations website also provides notifications of news or\nannouncements regarding our financial performance and other items of interest to our investors, including SEC\nfilings, investor events, press and earnings releases, and blogs. We also share Google news and product updates\non Google\u2019s Keyword blog at https://www.blog.google/, which may be of interest or material to our investors.\nFurther, corporate governance information, including our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, governance guidelines,\nboard committee charters, and code of conduct, is also available on our investor relations website under the\nheading \"Other.\" The content of our websites are not incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form\n10-Q or in any other report or document we file with the SEC, and any references to our websites are intended to be\ninactive textual references only.\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nFor quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, refer to Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and\nQualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2021.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the\neffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the\nend of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nBased on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of March 31,\n2022, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to\nprovide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the\nExchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s\nrules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our\nchief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required\ndisclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe rely extensively on information systems to manage our business and summarize and report operating\nresults. In 2019, we began a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system,\nwhich will replace much of our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain\nour financial records, enhance the flow of financial information, improve data management and provide timely\ninformation to our management team. The implementation is expected to continue in phases over the next few\nyears. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter\nended March 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control\nover financial reporting. However, as the phased implementation of the new ERP system continues, we will change\nour processes and procedures, which in turn, could result in changes to our internal control over financial reporting.\nAs such changes occur, we will evaluate quarterly whether such changes materially affect our internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nAs a result of COVID-19, our global workforce continued to operate primarily in a work from home environment\nfor the quarter ended March 31, 2022. While we continue to evolve our work model in response to the uneven\neffects of the ongoing pandemic around the world, we believe that our internal controls over financial reporting\ncontinue to be effective. We have continued to re-evaluate and refine our financial reporting process to provide\nreasonable assurance that we could report our financial results accurately and timely.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls\nand procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving\nthe desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that\nthere are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of\npossible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\n42",

Workforce Reduction and Other Initiatives\nWe have a company-wide effort underway to re-engineer our cost base. As part of this program, in January\n2023 we announced a reduction of our workforce, and as a result in the first quarter of 2023 we recorded employee\nseverance and related charges of $2.0 billion, representing the majority of expected costs associated with this\naction. In addition, we are taking actions to optimize our global office space, and as a result, we recorded charges\nrelated to office space reductions of $564 million in the first quarter of 2023. We may incur additional charges in the\nfuture as we further evaluate our real estate needs.\nThese severance and office space charges are included within our consolidated statements of income for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2023 as follows (in millions):\nSeverance and\nRelated (1) Office Space Total\nCost of revenues $ 461 $ 220 $ 681\nResearch and development 835 247 1,082\nSales and marketing 445 35 480\nGeneral and administrative 253 62 315\nTotal charges $ 1,994 $ 564 $ 2,558\n(1) Severance includes amounts to be settled in cash, accounted for as one-time involuntary employee termination benefits,\nand stock based compensation\nFor segment reporting, the substantial majority of these charges are included within unallocated corporate\ncosts in our segment results.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023, changes in liabilities resulting from the severance charges and\nrelated accruals were as follows (in millions):\nSeverance and\nRelated\nBalance as of December 31, 2022 $ 0\nCharges(1) 1,582\nCash payments (396)\nBalance as of March 31, 2023(2) $ 1,186\n(1) Excludes non-cash stock-based compensation of $412 million.\n(2) Included in Accrued compensation and benefits on the consolidated balance sheets.\nNote 8.

Compensation Plans\nStock-Based Compensation\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2023, total stock-based compensation (SBC) expense was\n$4.5 billion and $5.3 billion, including amounts associated with awards we expect to settle in Alphabet stock of $4.4\nbillion and $5.1 billion, respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2023 total SBC expense includes\n$412 million associated with workforce reduction costs. See Note 7 for further information.\nStock-Based Award Activities\nThe following table summarizes the activities for unvested Alphabet restricted stock units (RSUs) for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2023 (in millions, except per share amounts):\nUnvested Restricted Stock Units\nWeighted-\nAverage\nNumber of Grant-Date\nShares Fair Value\nUnvested as of December 31, 2022 324 $ 107.98\nGranted 234 $ 94.51\nVested (48) $ 100.25\nForfeited/canceled (10) $ 110.60\nUnvested as of March 31, 2023 500 $ 102.36\nAs of March 31, 2023, there was $48.6 billion of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs.\nThis amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.9 years.\nNote 13. Income Taxes\nThe following table presents provision for income taxes (in millions, except for effective tax rate):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2022 2023\nIncome before provision for income taxes $ 18,934 $ 18,205\nProvision for income taxes $ 2,498 $ 3,154\nEffective tax rate 13.2 % 17.3 %\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in\nevaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. The total amount of gross\nunrecognized tax benefits was $7.1 billion and $7.5 billion as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023,\nrespectively, of which $5.3 billion and $5.7 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate, respectively.\nNote 14. Information about Segments and Geographic Areas\nWe report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:\n\u2022 Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Google Maps,\nGoogle Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales\nof apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products such as\nYouTube Premium and YouTube TV.\n\u2022 Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for\nenterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues from fees received for Google Cloud Platform\nservices, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\n\u2022 Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues\nfrom Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\nRevenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering\nactivities, and hardware, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the\nintegrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are\nmanaged centrally at a consolidated level. These costs, including the associated depreciation and impairment, are\nallocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage, headcount, or revenue.\n28",

For additional information, see Note 1 of\nthe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n\u2022 Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, our segment reporting reflects two changes: (i) DeepMind, previously\nreported within Other Bets, is reported as part of Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs, and (ii) we\nupdated and simplified our cost allocation methodologies to provide our business leaders with increased\ntransparency for decision-making. Prior periods have been recast to conform to the current presentation.\nFor additional information, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item\n1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n\u2022 Beginning in 2023, the timing of our annual employee stock-based compensation awards shifted from\nJanuary to March. While the shift in timing itself will not affect the amount of stock-based compensation\nexpense over the full fiscal year 2023, it results in relatively less expense recognized in the first quarter\ncompared to the remaining quarters of the year.\n\u2022 Repurchases of Class A and Class C shares were $15.1 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023.\nSee Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report\non Form 10-Q for additional information.\n\u2022 Operating cash flow was $23.5 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023.\n\u2022 Capital expenditures, which primarily reflected investments in technical infrastructure, were $6.3 billion for\nthe three months ended March 31, 2023.\n\u2022 As of March 31, 2023, we had 190,711 employees, which includes almost all of the employees affected by\nthe reduction of our workforce. We expect most of those affected will no longer be reflected in our\nheadcount by the end of the second quarter of 2023, subject to local law and consultation requirements.\n34",

The TAC rate decreased from 21.9% to 21.5% from the three months ended March 31, 2022 to the\nthree months ended March 31, 2023 primarily due to a revenue mix shift from Google Network properties to Google\nSearch & other properties.

The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long-term growth\nof the business. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace, and form of capital\nreturn to stockholders.\nThe following table presents our cash flows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2022 2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 25,106 $ 23,509\nNet cash used in investing activities $ (9,051) $ (2,946)\nNet cash used in financing activities $ (16,214) $ (16,568)\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nOur largest source of cash provided by operations are advertising revenues generated by Google Search &\nother properties, Google Network properties, and YouTube properties. Additionally, we generate cash through sales\nof apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google\nCloud offerings and subscription-based products.\nOur primary uses of cash from operating activities include payments to distribution and Google Network\npartners, to employees for compensation, and to content providers. Other uses of cash from operating activities\ninclude payments to suppliers for hardware, to tax authorities for income taxes, and other general corporate\nexpenditures.\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased from the three months ended March 31, 2022 to the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2023 due to increased cash payments for costs and expenses, partially offset by an\nincrease in cash received from revenues.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nCash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of investments in marketable\nand non-marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of marketable and\nnon-marketable securities, purchases of property and equipment, and payments for acquisitions.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased from the three months ended March 31, 2022 to the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2023 primarily due to a decrease in purchases of property and equipment and a decrease\nin net purchases of and maturities and sales of marketable securities.\n40",

Revenues\nfrom Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.\nRevenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering\nactivities, and devices, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the\nintegrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are\nmanaged centrally at a consolidated level. These costs, including the associated depreciation and impairment, are\nallocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage, headcount, or revenue.\nCertain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs\nprimarily include AI-focused shared R&D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; corporate\ninitiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and\nlegal costs, including certain fines and settlements. Charges associated with employee severance and office space\nreductions during 2023 and employee severance in the first quarter of 2024, were not allocated to our segments.\nAdditionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are not allocated to our segments.\nOur operating segments are not evaluated using asset information.\n27",

The increase was primarily due to net unrealized gains in non-marketable equity securities due to fair value\nadjustments related to observable transactions and increased interest income due to interest rates.\nFor additional information, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of\nthis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe following table presents provision for income taxes (in millions, except effective tax rate):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2023 2024\nIncome before provision for income taxes $ 18,205 $ 28,315\nProvision for income taxes $ 3,154 $ 4,653\nEffective tax rate 17.3 % 16.4 %\nThe effective tax rate decreased from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2024, primarily due to the tax rule change related to U.S. federal foreign tax credits issued by the IRS in\nJuly 2023 and an increase in stock-based compensation-related tax benefits, partially offset by a decrease in the\nU.S. federal Foreign Derived Intangible Income tax deduction and an increase in taxes for certain U.S. jurisdictions.\nThe OECD is coordinating negotiations among more than 140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus\naround substantial changes to international tax policies, including the implementation of a minimum global effective\ntax rate of 15%. Some countries have already implemented the legislation effective January 1, 2024, and we expect\nothers to follow, however we do not expect a material change to our income tax provision for the 2024 fiscal year. As\nadditional jurisdictions enact such legislation, transitional rules lapse, and other provisions of the minimum tax\nlegislation become effective, we expect our effective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase in future years.\nFinancial Condition\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had $108.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities.\nCash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly liquid\ngovernment bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, and marketable equity\nsecurities.\nSources, Uses of Cash and Related Trends\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash\nflow that we generate from operations. The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long-term growth\nof the business. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace, and form of capital\nreturn to stockholders.\n38",

In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that\nthere are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of\npossible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\n42",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in\nAugust 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc.\n(\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that\nprovide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure, platform services, and applications; sales of other\nproducts and services, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and\ndevices.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated\nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUnaudited Interim Financial Information\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal\nrecurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of\nthe results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2025. We have made estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual\nresults could differ materially from these estimates.\nThese consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 filed with the SEC.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update\n(ASU) 2023-09 \"Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\" to expand the disclosure\nrequirements for income taxes. Upon adoption we will be required to disclose additional specified categories in the\nrate reconciliation in both percentage and dollar amounts. We will also be required to disclose the amount of income\ntaxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction, among other disclosure requirements. The standard is effective for our\n2025 annual period and can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We are currently assessing the effect\nthat the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03 \"Income Statement: Reporting Comprehensive Income-\nExpense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40)\" to improve the disclosures about an entity\u2019s expenses.\nUpon adoption, we will be required to disclose in the notes to the financial statements a disaggregation of certain\nexpense categories included within the expense captions on the face of the income statement. The standard is\neffective for our 2027 annual period, and our interim periods beginning in 2028, with early adoption permitted. The\nstandard can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We are currently assessing adoption timing and the\neffect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\nPrior Period Reclassifications\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.\n10",

In\naddition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain\nsimilar indemnification obligations to our agents.\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification\nagreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the\npayments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the\nfuture, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations or cash flows in a particular period.\nAs of March 31, 2025, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably\npossible.\nLegal Matters\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be\nreasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be\nestimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could\naffect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible\nlosses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.\nCertain outstanding matters seek speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts, substantial\nchanges to our business practices and products, or structural remedies. Significant judgment is required to\ndetermine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and\nwe may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of outstanding legal\nmatters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either individually or in\naggregate, have a material adverse effect.\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\nAntitrust Matters\nWe are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations as well as litigation on various competition\nmatters by regulatory authorities and private parties in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally, including\nthe following:\n\u2022 Shopping: In June 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google relating to its\ndisplay and ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European antitrust laws and imposed a\n\u20ac2.4 billion fine. In 2024, we made a cash payment of $3.0 billion for the fine.\n\u2022 Android: In July 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google\u2019s Android-related\ndistribution agreements infringed European antitrust laws, imposed a \u20ac4.3 billion fine, and directed the\ntermination of the conduct at issue. We appealed the EC decision and implemented changes to certain of\nour Android distribution practices. In September 2022, the General Court affirmed the EC decision but\nreduced the fine from \u20ac4.3 billion to \u20ac4.1 billion. We subsequently appealed the General Court's affirmation\nof the EC decision with the European Court of Justice, which remains pending. In 2018, we recognized a\ncharge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in 2022.\n\u2022 AdSense for Search: In March 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google's\nagreements with AdSense for Search partners infringed European antitrust laws, imposed a fine of \u20ac1.5\nbillion, and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners' agreements, which we implemented\n25",

Compensation Plans\nStock-Based Compensation\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2025, total stock-based compensation (SBC) expense was\n$5.3 billion and $5.5 billion, including amounts associated with awards we expect to settle in Alphabet stock of $5.1\nbillion and $5.3 billion, respectively.\nStock-Based Award Activities\nThe following table summarizes the activities for unvested Alphabet restricted stock units (RSUs), which\ninclude dividend equivalents awarded to holders of unvested stock, for the three months ended March 31, 2025 (in\nmillions, except per share amounts):\nWeighted-\nAverage\nNumber of Grant-Date\nShares Fair Value\nUnvested as of December 31, 2024 299 $ 122.77\nGranted 135 $ 176.15\nVested (44) $ 124.19\nForfeited/canceled (6) $ 127.79\nUnvested as of March 31, 2025 384 $ 141.29\nAs of March 31, 2025, there was $52.5 billion of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs.\nThis amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.9 years.\nNote 14. Income Taxes\nThe following table presents provision for income taxes (in millions, except for effective tax rate):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2024 2025\nIncome before provision for income taxes $ 28,315 $ 41,789\nProvision for income taxes $ 4,653 $ 7,249\nEffective tax rate 16.4 % 17.3 %\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in\nevaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. The total amount of gross\nunrecognized tax benefits was $12.6 billion and $13.5 billion, of which $10.0 billion and $10.8 billion, if recognized,\nwould affect our effective tax rate, as of December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, respectively.\nNote 15. Information about Segments and Geographic Areas\nWe report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:\n\u2022 Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Google Maps,\nGoogle Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; fees\nreceived for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium,\nand NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One; the sale of apps and in-app purchases; and devices.\n\u2022 Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, applications, and other services for enterprise\ncustomers. Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from consumption-based fees and subscriptions\nreceived for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools,\nand other enterprise services.\n\u2022 Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues\nfrom Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.\nRevenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering\nactivities, and devices, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the\nintegrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are\nmanaged centrally at a consolidated level. These costs, including the associated depreciation, are allocated to\noperating segments as a service cost generally based on usage, headcount, or revenue.\n30",

This increase was primarily due to lower effective tax rate impacts in the U.S. federal Foreign\nDerived Intangible Income tax deduction, R&D credits, and stock-based compensation-related tax benefits.\nThe OECD is coordinating negotiations among more than 140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus\naround substantial changes to international tax policies, including the implementation of a minimum global effective\ntax rate of 15%. Some countries have already implemented the legislation effective January 1, 2024, and we expect\nothers to follow, however this did not have a material effect on our income tax provision for the period ending\nMarch 31, 2025.\nFinancial Condition\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities\nAs of March 31, 2025, we had $95.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities.\nCash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly liquid\ngovernment bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, and marketable equity\nsecurities.\nSources, Uses of Cash and Related Trends\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash\nflow that we generate from operations. The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long-term growth\nof the business. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace, and form of capital\nreturn to stockholders.\nThe following table presents cash flows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2024 2025\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 28,848 $ 36,150\nNet cash used in investing activities $ (8,564) $ (16,194)\nNet cash used in financing activities $ (19,714) $ (20,201)\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nOur largest source of cash provided by operations are advertising revenues generated by Google Search &\nother properties, Google Network properties, and YouTube properties. In Google Services, we also generate cash\nthrough consumer subscriptions, the sale of apps and in-app purchases, and devices. In Google Cloud, we\ngenerate cash through consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, applications, and\nother cloud services.\nOur primary uses of cash from operating activities include payments to distribution and Google Network\npartners, to employees for compensation, and to content providers. Other uses of cash from operating activities\ninclude payments to suppliers for devices, to tax authorities for income taxes, and other general corporate\nexpenditures.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased from the three months ended March 31, 2024 to the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2025 due to an increase in cash received from customers, partially offset by an increase in\ncash payments for cost of revenues and operating expenses.\n42",

This reflects, when rounding to the\none decimal place, the percentage change in consolidated revenues and consolidated constant currency revenues year\nover year of 12.6% and 16.3%, respectively.\n\u2022 Revenues were $69.7 billion, an increase of 13% year over year, primarily driven by an increase in Google\nServices segment revenues of $5.8 billion or 10% and an increase in Google Cloud segment revenues of\n$1.6 billion or 36%.\n\u2022 Cost of revenues was $30.1 billion, an increase of 15% year over year, driven by increases in other costs of\nrevenues and TAC.\n\u2022 Operating expenses were $20.1 billion, an increase of 24% year over year, primarily driven by increases in\ncompensation due to headcount growth, professional services fees and advertising and promotional\nexpenses. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in charges related to legal matters.\nOther information\n\u2022 On July 15, 2022, the company executed a 20-for-one stock split with a record date of July 1, 2022, effected\nin the form of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the company's Class A, Class B, and\nClass C stock. All references made to share or per share amounts throughout this Management's\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations have been retroactively adjusted\nto reflect the effects of the Stock Split. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.\n\u2022 Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, we suspended the vast majority of our commercial activities in Russia\nand effectively ceased business activities of our Russian entity. The ongoing effect of these direct actions on\nour financial results was not material. The broader economic effects resulting from the war in Ukraine on our\nfuture financial results may be unpredictable.\n\u2022 Repurchases of Class A and Class C shares were $15.2 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2022.\nIn April 2022, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional\n$70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.\n\u2022 Operating cash flow was $19.4 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2022.\n\u2022 Capital expenditures of $6.8 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2022 primarily relate to\ninvestments in technical infrastructure.\n36",

We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues and non-GAAP percentage change in constant\ncurrency revenues for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period\ncomparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps\nimprove the ability to understand our performance because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that\nare not indicative of our core operating results.\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant\nperiod over period. We define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the effect of foreign\nexchange rate movements and hedging activities, and use it to determine the constant currency revenue\npercentage change on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current\nperiod revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects\nrealized in the current period.\nConstant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period\nrevenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are\ntranslated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of\nboth periods.\nThese results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with\nGAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled\nmeasures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table presents the foreign exchange effect on international revenues and total revenues (in\nmillions, except percentages):\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n% Change % Change\nfrom Prior from Prior\n2021 2022 Year 2021 2022 Year\nEMEA revenues $ 19,084 $ 20,533 8 % $ 36,115 $ 40,850 13 %\nEMEA constant currency revenues 22,489 18 % $ 44,117 22 %\nAPAC revenues 11,231 11,710 4 % $ 21,686 $ 23,551 9 %\nAPAC constant currency revenues 12,466 11 % $ 24,906 15 %\nOther Americas revenues 3,364 4,340 29 % $ 6,269 $ 8,182 31 %\nOther Americas constant currency\nrevenues 4,310 28 % $ 8,233 31 %\nUnited States revenues 28,208 32,727 16 % $ 53,240 $ 64,460 21 %\nHedging gains (losses) (7) 375 $ (116) $ 653\nTotal revenues $ 61,880 $ 69,685 13 % $ 117,194 $ 137,696 17 %\nRevenues, excluding hedging effect $ 61,887 $ 69,310 $ 117,310 $ 137,043\nExchange rate effect 2,682 4,673\nTotal constant currency revenues $ 71,992 16 % $ 141,716 21 %\nEMEA revenue growth from the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 to the three and six months ended\nJune 30, 2022 was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the U.S.\ndollar strengthening relative to the Euro and British pound.\nAPAC revenue growth from the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 to the three and six months ended\nJune 30, 2022 was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the U.S.\ndollar strengthening relative to the Japanese yen.\n39",

We also share Google news and product updates\non Google\u2019s Keyword blog at https://www.blog.google/, which may be of interest or material to our investors.\nFurther, corporate governance information, including our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, governance guidelines,\nboard committee charters, and code of conduct, is also available on our investor relations website under the\nheading \"Other.\" The content of our websites are not incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form\n10-Q or in any other report or document we file with the SEC, and any references to our websites are intended to be\ninactive textual references only.\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nFor quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, refer to Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and\nQualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2021.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the\neffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the\nend of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nBased on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of June 30,\n2022, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to\nprovide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the\nExchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s\nrules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our\nchief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required\ndisclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe rely extensively on information systems to manage our business and summarize and report operating\nresults. In 2019, we began a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system,\nwhich will replace much of our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain\nour financial records, enhance the flow of financial information, improve data management and provide timely\ninformation to our management team. To date, significant progress has been made with the implementation of\nvarious modules. Additional implementation activities are expected to continue in phases over the next few years.\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended\nJune 30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over\nfinancial reporting. However, as the phased implementation of the new ERP system continues, we will change our\nprocesses and procedures, which in turn, could result in changes to our internal control over financial reporting. As\nsuch changes occur, we will evaluate quarterly whether such changes materially affect our internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls\nand procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving\nthe desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that\nthere are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of\npossible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\n46",

For additional information, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n\u2022 Repurchases of Class A and Class C shares were $15.1 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2023.\nSee Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report\non Form 10-Q for additional information.\n\u2022 Operating cash flow was $28.7 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2023, and was affected by the\n2023 IRS payment deferral relief made available to tax payers headquartered in designated counties in\nCalifornia.\n\u2022 Capital expenditures, which primarily reflected investments in technical infrastructure, were $6.9 billion for\nthe three months ended June 30, 2023.\n\u2022 As of June 30, 2023, we had 181,798 employees. The substantial majority of the employees affected by the\nreduction of our workforce are no longer included in our headcount as of June 30, 2023.

The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long-term growth\nof the business. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace, and form of capital\nreturn to stockholders.\nThe following table presents our cash flows (in millions):\nSix Months Ended\nJune 30,\n2022 2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 44,528 $ 52,175\nNet cash used in investing activities $ (13,238) $ (13,746)\nNet cash used in financing activities $ (34,031) $ (34,403)\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nOur largest source of cash provided by operations are advertising revenues generated by Google Search &\nother properties, Google Network properties, and YouTube properties. Additionally, we generate cash through sales\nof apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google\nCloud offerings and subscription-based products.\nOur primary uses of cash from operating activities include payments to distribution and Google Network\npartners, to employees for compensation, and to content providers. Other uses of cash from operating activities\ninclude payments to suppliers for hardware, to tax authorities for income taxes, and other general corporate\nexpenditures.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased from the six months ended June 30, 2022 to the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2023 due to the 2023 IRS payment deferral relief made available to taxpayers\n45",

Commitments and Contingencies\nCommitments\nWe have content licensing agreements with future fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments of $9.7 billion as\nof June 30, 2024, of which the majority is paid quarterly through the first quarter of 2030.\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate\nactivities, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network partners, distribution partners,\ncustomers of Google Cloud offerings, lessors, and service providers with respect to certain matters. We have\nagreed to defend and/or hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or\ncovenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these\nagreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In\naddition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain\nsimilar indemnification obligations to our agents.\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification\nagreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the\npayments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the\nfuture, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations or cash flows in a particular period.\nAs of June 30, 2024, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably\npossible.\nLegal Matters\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be\nreasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be\nestimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could\naffect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible\nlosses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.\nCertain outstanding matters seek speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts, substantial\nchanges to our business practices and products, or structural remedies. Significant judgment is required to\ndetermine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and\nwe may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of outstanding legal\nmatters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either individually or in\naggregate, have a material adverse effect.\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\nAntitrust Matters\nOn November 30, 2010, the EC's Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various\nantitrust-related complaints against us.\n\u2022 On June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display\nand ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision\nimposed a \u20ac2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC\ndecision to the General Court, and on September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring\nshopping ads into compliance with the EC's decision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion for the fine in\nthe second quarter of 2017. On November 10, 2021, the General Court rejected our appeal, and we\nsubsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice on January 20, 2022.\n\u2022 On July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google\u2019s Android-related\ndistribution agreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a \u20ac4.3 billion ($5.1\nbillion as of June 30, 2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018,\nwe appealed the EC decision, and on October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android\ndistribution practices. On September 14, 2022, the General Court reduced the fine from \u20ac4.3 billion to\n\u20ac4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice. In 2018, we recognized a\ncharge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in 2022.\n25",

Significant judgment is required in\nevaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. The total amount of gross\nunrecognized tax benefits was $9.4 billion and $10.7 billion, of which $7.4 billion and $8.6 billion, if recognized,\nwould affect our effective tax rate, as of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2024, respectively.\nNote 13. Information about Segments and Geographic Areas\nWe report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:\n\u2022 Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Google Maps,\nGoogle Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; fees\nreceived for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium,\nand NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One; the sale of apps and in-app purchases and devices.\n\u2022 Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for\nenterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from consumption-based fees and\nsubscriptions received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and\ncollaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\n\u2022 Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues\nfrom Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.\nRevenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering\nactivities, and devices, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments.

We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP\npercentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for\nfinancial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe\nthe presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to\nunderstand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of\nour core operating results.\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant\nperiod over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency\nexchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated\nlevel. We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a\nyear-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior\nyear comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.\nConstant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period\nrevenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are\ntranslated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of\nboth periods.\nThese results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with\nGAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled\nmeasures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table presents the foreign currency exchange effect on international revenues and total revenues\n(in millions, except percentages):\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2024\n% Change from Prior Period\nThree Months Ended\nJune 30, Constant Less Constant\nLess FX Currency As Hedging Less FX Currency\n2023 2024 Effect Revenues Reported Effect Effect Revenues\nUnited States $ 35,073 $ 41,196 $ 0 $ 41,196 17 % 0 % 17 %\nEMEA 22,289 24,683 (367) 25,050 11 % (1) % 12 %\nAPAC 12,728 13,823 (595) 14,418 9 % (4) % 13 %\nOther Americas 4,511 4,938 (305) 5,243 9 % (7) % 16 %\nRevenues, excluding hedging\neffect 74,601 84,640 (1,267) 85,907 13 % (2) % 15 %\nHedging gains (losses) 3 102\nTotal revenues(1) $ 74,604 $ 84,742 $ 85,907 14 % 1 % (2) % 15 %\n(1) Total constant currency revenues of $85.9 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2024 increased $11.3 billion\ncompared to $74.6 billion in revenues, excluding hedging effect, for the three months ended June 30, 2023.\nEMEA revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due\nto the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Turkish lira.\nAPAC revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due\nto the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Japanese yen.\nOther Americas revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates,\nprimarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Argentine peso.\n39",

As stock units are not outstanding shares of stock and thus would not otherwise be entitled to\nparticipate in any dividends (including the one referenced above), the crediting of dividend equivalent units is\nintended to preserve the equity-based incentives intended by the company when the stock units were granted and\nto treat the holders of stock units consistently with all stockholders.\n50",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in\nAugust 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc.\n(\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that\nprovide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure, platform services, and applications; sales of other\nproducts and services, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and\ndevices.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated\nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUnaudited Interim Financial Information\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal\nrecurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of\nthe results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2025. We have made estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual\nresults could differ materially from these estimates.\nThese consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 filed with the SEC.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update\n(ASU) 2023-09 \"Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\" to expand the disclosure\nrequirements for income taxes. Upon adoption, we will be required to disclose additional specified categories in the\nrate reconciliation in both percentage and dollar amounts. We will also be required to disclose the amount of income\ntaxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction, among other disclosure requirements. The standard, which is effective for\nour 2025 annual period, can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively and we are currently assessing which\nmethod to adopt.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03 \"Income Statement: Reporting Comprehensive Income-\nExpense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40)\" to improve the disclosures about an entity\u2019s expenses.\nUpon adoption, we will be required to disclose in the notes to the financial statements a disaggregation of certain\nexpense categories included within the expense captions on the face of the income statement. The standard is\neffective for our 2027 annual period, and our interim periods beginning in 2028, with early adoption permitted. The\nstandard can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We are currently assessing adoption timing and the\neffect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\nPrior Period Reclassifications\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.\n12",

        "text": "Financial filing text section: As of June 30, 2025, we had material purchase commitments and other contractual obligations of $72.5 billion,\nof which $51.0 billion was short-term. These amounts primarily consist of purchase orders for certain technical\ninfrastructure as well as the non-cancelable portion or the minimum cancellation fee in certain agreements related to\ncommitments to purchase licenses, including content licenses, inventory, and network capacity. For those\nagreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities\nand/or pricing as of June 30, 2025. In certain instances, the amount of our contractual obligations may change\nbased on the expected timing of order fulfillment from our suppliers. For more information related to our content\nlicenses, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report\non Form 10-Q.\nIn addition, we regularly enter into multi-year, non-cancellable agreements to purchase renewable energy and\nenergy attributes, such as renewable energy certificates.

For example, civil judgments that include compounding\npenalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including\nthose of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.\nNon-Income Taxes\nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters.\nThe subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied\nto the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We\naccrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax\nauthorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and\nthe loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity\nand uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially\ndifferent from our expectations.\nSee Note 13 for information regarding income tax contingencies.\nNote 10.

Compensation Plans\nStock-Based Compensation\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, total stock based compensation (SBC) expense\nwas $5.8 billion and $5.9 billion, including amounts associated with awards we expect to settle in Alphabet stock of\n$5.6 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, total SBC\nexpense was $16.5 billion and $17.0 billion, including amounts associated with awards we expect to settle in\nAlphabet stock of $16.3 billion and $16.4 billion, respectively.\nStock-Based Award Activities\nThe following table summarizes the activities for unvested Alphabet restricted stock units (RSUs), which\ninclude dividend equivalents awarded to holders of unvested stock, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\n(in millions, except per share amounts):\nWeighted-\nAverage\nNumber of Grant-Date\nShares Fair Value\nUnvested as of December 31, 2023 338 $ 104.93\nGranted 185 $ 138.23\nVested (150) $ 110.04\nForfeited/canceled (29) $ 112.01\nUnvested as of September 30, 2024 344 $ 119.95\nAs of September 30, 2024, there was $39.6 billion of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested\nRSUs. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.6 years.\nNote 13.

Significant judgment is required in\nevaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. The total amount of gross\nunrecognized tax benefits was $9.4 billion and $12.0 billion, of which $7.4 billion and $9.5 billion, if recognized,\nwould affect our effective tax rate, as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, respectively.\nNote 14.

        "text": "Financial filing text section: Provision for Income Taxes\nThe following table presents provision for income taxes (in millions, except effective tax rate):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2023 2024 2023 2024\nIncome before provision for income taxes $ 21,197 $ 31,706 $ 61,305 $ 87,572\nProvision for income taxes $ 1,508 $ 5,405 $ 8,197 $ 13,990\nEffective tax rate 7.1 % 17.0 % 13.4 % 16.0 %\nThe effective tax rate increased from the three months ended September 30, 2023 to the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024. This increase was primarily due to a cumulative one-time adjustment recorded for tax rule\nchanges issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the third quarter of 2023. Additionally, a decrease in the\nU.S. federal Foreign Derived Intangible Income tax deduction in 2024 contributed to the higher effective tax rate.\nThe effective tax rate increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024. This increase was primarily due to a one-time adjustment for tax rule changes issued by the\nIRS in the third quarter of 2023. Additionally, a decrease in the 2024 U.S. federal Foreign Derived Intangible Income\ntax deduction contributed to an increase in the effective tax rate. These factors were partially offset by an increase\nin stock-based compensation-related tax benefits in 2024.\nThe OECD is coordinating negotiations among more than 140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus\naround substantial changes to international tax policies, including the implementation of a minimum global effective\ntax rate of 15%. Some countries have already implemented the legislation effective January 1, 2024, and we expect\nothers to follow, however we do not expect a material change to our income tax provision for the 2024 fiscal year. As\nadditional jurisdictions enact such legislation, transitional rules lapse, and other provisions of the minimum tax\nlegislation become effective, we expect our effective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase in future years.\nFinancial Condition\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had $93.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable\nsecurities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly\nliquid government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, and marketable\nequity securities.\nSources, Uses of Cash and Related Trends\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash\nflow that we generate from operations. The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long-term growth\nof the business. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace, and form of capital\nreturn to stockholders.\nThe following table presents our cash flows (in millions):\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2023 2024\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 82,831 $ 86,186\nNet cash used in investing activities $ (20,896) $ (29,356)\nNet cash used in financing activities $ (52,785) $ (60,697)\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nOur largest source of cash provided by operations are advertising revenues generated by Google Search &\nother properties, Google Network properties, and YouTube properties. In Google Services, we also generate cash\nthrough consumer subscriptions, the sale of apps and in-app purchases, and devices. In Google Cloud, we\ngenerate cash through consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, collaboration tools,\nand other cloud services.\nOur primary uses of cash from operating activities include payments to distribution and Google Network\npartners, to employees for compensation, and to content providers. Other uses of cash from operating activities\n44",
