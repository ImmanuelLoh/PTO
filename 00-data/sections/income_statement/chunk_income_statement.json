The increase was primarily due to fluctuations in the value of equity securities reflecting market driven changes in the value of our marketable equity securities, investment specific event driven changes in our non-marketable equity securities, and increased interest income due to interest rates. For additional information, see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Provision for Income Taxes The following table presents provision for income taxes (in millions, except for effective tax rate): Year Ended December 31, 2022 2023 Income before provision for income taxes $ 71,328 $ 85,717 Provision for income taxes $ 11,356 $ 11,922 Effective tax rate 15.9 % 13.9 % In 2023, the Internal Revenue Services (IRS) issued a rule change allowing taxpayers to temporarily apply the regulations in effect prior to 2022 related to U.S. federal foreign tax credits, as well as a separate rule change with interim guidance on the capitalization and amortization of R&D expenses. A cumulative one-time adjustment applicable to the prior period for these tax rule changes was recorded in 2023. The effective tax rate decreased from 2022 to 2023, reflecting the effect of the two tax rule changes described above, particularly the change related to foreign tax credits. The effect of these tax rule changes was partially offset by changes in uncertain tax benefits and a decrease in the U.S. federal Foreign Derived Intangible Income tax deduction. The OECD is coordinating negotiations among more than 140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus around substantial changes to international tax policies, including the implementation of a minimum global effective tax rate of 15%. While various countries have implemented the legislation as of January 1, 2024, we do not expect a resulting material change to our income tax provision for the 2024 fiscal year. As additional jurisdictions enact such legislation, we expect our effective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase in future years. Financial Condition Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities As of December 31, 2023, we had $110.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly liquid government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, and marketable equity securities. Sources, Uses of Cash and Related Trends Our principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from operations. The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for",

The increase in TAC from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months ended March 31, 2024 was largely due to an increase in TAC paid to distribution partners, primarily driven by growth in revenues subject to TAC. The TAC rate decreased from 21.5% to 21.0% from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months ended March 31, 2024 primarily due to a revenue mix shift from Google Network properties to Google Search & other properties. The TAC rate on Google Search & other revenues was substantially consistent from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months ended March 31, 2024. The TAC rate on Google Network revenues reflected a slight increase from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months ended March 31, 2024 due to a combination of factors, none of which were individually significant. The increase in other cost of revenues from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months ended March 31, 2024 was primarily due to increases in content acquisition costs, largely for YouTube, and depreciation expense. These increases were partially offset by decreases in compensation expenses, largely the result of a reduction in employee severance and related charges of $308 million, and charges related to our office space optimization efforts of $220 million. Research and Development The following table presents R&D expenses (in millions, except percentages): Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 2024 Research and development expenses $ 11,468 $ 11,903 Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues 16 % 15 % R&D expenses increased $435 million from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily driven by increases in depreciation expense of $308 million and third-party services fees of $253 million, partially offset by a decrease in charges associated with our office space optimization efforts of $247 million. Additionally, a decrease in compensation expenses of $64 million was primarily the result of a reduction in employee severance and related charges of $588 million. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in SBC expense of $320 million, excluding employee severance and related charges.

EMEA revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the euro. APAC revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Japanese yen, Australian dollar, and South Korean won.

The increase in TAC from the three months ended March 31, 2024 to the three months ended March 31, 2025 was largely due to an increase in TAC paid to distribution partners, primarily driven by growth in revenues subject to TAC. The TAC rate decreased from 21.0% to 20.6% from the three months ended March 31, 2024 to the three months ended March 31, 2025 primarily due to a revenue mix shift from Google Network properties to Google Search & other properties. The TAC rate on Google Search & other revenues increased from the three months ended March 31, 2024 to the three months ended March 31, 2025 primarily due to increases related to mobile searches, which carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points.

Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues. \u2022 TAC includes: \u25e6 Amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers. \u25e6 Amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties. \u2022 Other cost of revenues includes: \u25e6 Content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee). \u25e6 Expenses associated with our data centers (including bandwidth, compensation expenses, depreciation, energy, and other equipment costs) as well as other operations costs (such as content review as well as customer and product support costs). \u25e6 Inventory and other costs related to the hardware we sell. TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly higher than TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search & other properties, because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners. Operating Expenses Operating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as either R&D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative. The main components of our R&D expenses are: \u2022 compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&D related to our existing and new products and services; \u2022 depreciation; and \u2022 third-party services fees primarily relating to consulting and outsourced services in support of our engineering and product development efforts. The main components of our sales and marketing expenses are: \u2022 compensation expenses for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain customer service functions; and \u2022 spending relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services. The main components of our general and administrative expenses are: \u2022 compensation expenses for employees in finance, human resources, information technology, legal, and other administrative support functions; \u2022 expenses relating to legal matters, including fines and settlements; and \u2022 third-party services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and other outsourced administrative services. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net primarily consists of interest income (expense), the effect of foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net gains (losses) and impairment on our marketable and non-marketable securities, performance fees, and income (loss) and impairment from our equity method investments. For additional details, including how we account for our investments and factors that can drive fluctuations in the value of our investments, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 and Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for 35",

Cost of revenues increased $2.8 billion from the six months ended June 30, 2022 to the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in other cost of revenues of $2.8 billion. The increase in TAC from the three months ended June 30, 2022 to the three months ended June 30, 2023 was largely due to an increase in TAC paid to distribution partners, primarily driven by growth in revenues subject to TAC. TAC was relatively unchanged from the six months ended June 30, 2022 to the six months ended June 30, 2023. The TAC rate decreased from 21.7% to 21.6% from the three months ended June 30, 2022 to the three months ended June 30, 2023 and decreased from 21.8% to 21.5% from the six months ended June 30, 2022 to the six months ended June 30, 2023 primarily due to a revenue mix shift from Google Network properties to Google Search & other properties. The TAC rate on Google Search & other revenues and the TAC rate on Google Network revenues were both substantially consistent from the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase in other cost of revenues from the three months ended June 30, 2022 to the three months ended June 30, 2023 was primarily due to increases in content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, and hardware costs. An overall increase in data center and other operations costs was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in the estimated useful lives of our servers and certain network equipment. The increase in other cost of revenues from the six months ended June 30, 2022 to the six months ended June 30, 2023 was primarily due to increases in content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, and data center and other operations costs. The overall increase in data center and other operations costs includes $700 million of charges related to employee severance associated with the reduction of our workforce and our office space optimization efforts, partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in the estimated useful lives of our servers and certain network equipment.

For the periods presented above, the holders of each class are entitled to equal per share dividends or distributions in liquidation in accordance with the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Alphabet Inc. Holders of Alphabet unvested stock units are awarded dividend equivalents, which are subject to the same vesting conditions as the underlying award, and settled in Class C shares. Immaterial differences in net income per share across our Class A, Class B, and Class C shares may arise due to the allocation of distributed earnings based on the holders as of the record date, compared with the allocation of undistributed earnings and number of shares based on weighted average over the periods. 30",
