Our mission to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant today as it was when we were founded in 1998. Since then, we have evolved from a company that helps people find answers to a company that also helps people get things done. We are focused on building an even more helpful Google for everyone, and we aspire to give everyone the tools they need to increase their knowledge, health, happiness, and success. Google Search helps people find information and make sense of the world in more natural and intuitive ways, with trillions of searches on Google every year. YouTube provides people with entertainment, information, and opportunities to learn something new. Google Assistant offers the best way to get things done seamlessly across different devices, providing intelligent help throughout a person's day, no matter where they are. Google Cloud helps customers solve today\u2019s business challenges, improve productivity, reduce costs, and unlock new growth engines. We are continually innovating and building new products and features that will help our users, partners, customers, and communities and have invested more than $100 billion in research and development in the last five years in support of these efforts. 4",

Understanding Alphabet\u2019s Financial Results Alphabet is a collection of businesses \u2014 the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, Google Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For further details on our segments, see Part I, Item 1 \u201cBusiness\u201d and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect The following long-term trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate that they will continue to affect our future results: \u2022 Users' behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves. The continuing shift from an offline to online world has contributed to the growth of our business and our revenues since inception. We expect that this shift to an online world will continue to benefit our business and our revenues, although at a slower pace than we have experienced historically, in particular after the outsized growth in our advertising revenues during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we face increasing competition for user engagement and advertisers, which may affect our revenues. \u2022 Users continue to access our products and services using diverse devices and modalities, which allows for new advertising formats that may benefit our revenues but adversely affect our margins. Our users are accessing the Internet via diverse devices and modalities, such as smartphones, wearables, and smart home devices, and want to be able to be connected no matter where they are or what they are doing. We are focused on expanding our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to maintain and grow our business. We benefit from advertising revenues generated from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising formats. The margins from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional desktop search. Additionally, as the market for a particular device type or modality matures, our advertising revenues may be affected. For example, growth in the global smartphone market has slowed due to various factors, including increased market saturation in developed countries, which can affect our mobile advertising revenues. We expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our revenues grow and TAC as a percentage of our advertising revenues (\"TAC rate\") to be affected by changes in device",

We expect these trends to continue to affect our revenues and put pressure on our margins. \u2022 As online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings, which may affect our monetization. As interactions between users and advertisers change, and as online user behavior evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings to serve these changing needs, which may affect our monetization. For example, revenues from ads on YouTube and Google Play monetize at a lower rate than our traditional search ads. We also may develop new products incorporating AI innovations that could affect our monetization trends. Additionally, when developing new products and services we generally focus first on user experience before prioritizing monetization. \u2022 As users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets continue to increase, and may require continued investments. In addition, movements in foreign exchange rates affect such revenues. The shift to online, as well as the advent of the multi-device world, has brought opportunities outside of the U.S., including in emerging markets, such as India. We continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our products and advertising programs relevant to our users in these markets. This has led to a trend of increased 26",

Additionally, fluctuations in our revenues generated from advertising (\"Google advertising\"), revenues from other sources (\"Google other revenues\"), Google Cloud, and Other Bets revenues have been and may continue to be affected by other factors unique to each set of revenues, as described below. Google Services Google Services revenues consist of Google advertising as well as Google other revenues. Google Advertising Google advertising revenues are comprised of the following: \u2022 Google Search & other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play; \u2022 YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and \u2022 Google Network, which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. We use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our advertising revenues: paid clicks and cost-per-click pertain to traffic on Google Search & other properties, while impressions and cost-per-impression pertain to traffic on our Google Network properties. Paid clicks represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users on Google search properties and other Google owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play. Cost- per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users. Impressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based revenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression displayed to users. As our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues generated by the corresponding click and impression activity. Fluctuations in our advertising revenues, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search & other properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties and the correlation between these items have been and may continue to be affected by additional factors, such as: \u2022 advertiser competition for keywords; \u2022 changes in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy; \u2022 changes in device mix; \u2022 seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends, such as traditional retail seasonality; and \u2022 traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various verticals and channels. Google Other Google other revenues are comprised of the following: \u2022 Google Play, which includes sales of apps and in-app purchases; \u2022 hardware, which includes sales of Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, and Pixel devices; \u2022 YouTube non-advertising, which includes subscription revenues from services such as YouTube Premium",

Fluctuations in our Google other revenues have been and may continue to be affected by additional factors, such as changes in customer usage and demand, number of subscribers, and fluctuations in the timing of product launches. Google Cloud Google Cloud revenues are comprised of the following: \u2022 Google Cloud Platform, which includes fees for infrastructure, platform, and other services; \u2022 Google Workspace, which includes fees for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for enterprises, such as Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar and Meet; and \u2022 other enterprise services. Fluctuations in our Google Cloud revenues have been and may continue to be affected by additional factors, such as customer usage. Other Bets Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services. Costs and Expenses Our cost structure has two components: cost of revenues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses include costs related to R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of our costs and expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues. \u2022 TAC includes: \u25e6 Amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers. \u25e6 Amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties. \u2022 Other cost of revenues includes: \u25e6 Content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee). \u25e6 Expenses associated with our data centers (including bandwidth, compensation expenses, depreciation, energy, and other equipment costs) as well as other operations costs (such as content review as well as customer and product support costs). \u25e6 Inventory and other costs related to the hardware we sell. TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly higher than TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search & other properties, because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners. Operating Expenses Operating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as either R&D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative. The main components of our R&D expenses are: \u2022 compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&D related to our existing and new products and services; \u2022 depreciation; and \u2022 third-party services fees primarily relating to consulting and outsourced services in support of our engineering and product development efforts. 29",

Impressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based revenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression displayed to users. As our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues generated by the corresponding click and impression activity. Fluctuations in our advertising revenues, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search & other properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties and the correlation between these items have been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition to the general factors described above, such as: \u2022 advertiser competition for keywords; \u2022 changes in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy; \u2022 changes in device mix; \u2022 seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends, such as traditional retail seasonality; and \u2022 traffic growth in emerging markets",

Costs and Expenses Cost of Revenues The following table presents cost of revenues, including TAC (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2021 2022 2023 TAC $ 45,566 $ 48,955 $ 50,886 Other cost of revenues 65,373 77,248 82,446 Total cost of revenues $ 110,939 $ 126,203 $ 133,332 Total cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues 43 % 45 % 43 % Cost of revenues increased $7.1 billion from 2022 to 2023 due to an increase in other cost of revenues and TAC of $5.2 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. The increase in TAC from 2022 to 2023 was largely due to an increase in TAC paid to distribution partners, primarily driven by growth in revenues subject to TAC. The TAC rate decreased from 21.8% to 21.4% from 2022 to 2023 primarily due to a revenue mix shift from Google Network properties to Google Search & other properties. The TAC rate on Google Search & other revenues and the TAC rate on Google Network revenues were both substantially consistent from 2022 to 2023. The increase in other cost of revenues from 2022 to 2023 was primarily due to increases in content acquisition costs, largely for YouTube, and compensation expenses, which included $479 million of charges related to employee severance associated with the reduction in our workforce. Additionally, other cost of revenues benefited from a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in estimated useful lives of our servers and network equipment. The increase in other cost of revenues of $11.9 billion from 2021 to 2022 was primarily due to increases in device costs, compensation expenses, depreciation, and equipment-related expenses. Research and Development The following table presents R&D expenses (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2022 2023 Research and development expenses $ 39,500 $ 45,427 Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues 14 % 15 % R&D expenses increased $5.9 billion from 2022 to 2023 primarily driven by an increase in compensation expenses of $2.9 billion, $870 million in charges related to our office space optimization efforts, and an increase in depreciation expense of $722 million. The $2.9 billion increase in compensation expenses was largely the result of a 4% increase in average headcount, after adjusting for roles affected by the reduction in our workforce, and an increase in SBC expense. Additionally, the increase in compensation expenses included $848 million in employee severance charges associated with the reduction in our workforce. The $722 million increase in depreciation expense reflected an offsetting benefit of the change in the estimated useful lives of our servers and network equipment.

We do not intend to become one.\" That unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history, inspiring us to tackle big problems and invest in moonshots. It led us to be a pioneer in the development of AI and, since 2016, an AI-first company. We continue this work under the leadership of Alphabet and Google CEO, Sundar Pichai. Alphabet is a collection of businesses \u2014 the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, Google Services and Google Cloud, and all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Supporting these businesses, we have centralized certain AI-related research and development which is reported in Alphabet-level activities. Alphabet's structure is about helping",

Our mission to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant today as it was when we were founded in 1998. Since then, we have evolved from a company that helps people find answers to a company that also helps people get things done. We are focused on building an even more helpful Google for everyone, and we aspire to give everyone the tools they need to increase their knowledge, health, happiness, and success. Google Search helps people find information and make sense of the world in more natural and intuitive ways, with trillions of searches on Google every year. YouTube provides people with entertainment, information, and opportunities to learn something new and helps support the creator economy through the YouTube Partner Program. Google Cloud helps customers solve today\u2019s business challenges, improve productivity, reduce costs, and unlock new growth engines.

Fluctuations in our Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues have been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition to the general factors described above, such as changes in customer usage and demand, number of subscribers, and the timing of product launches. Google Cloud Google Cloud revenues are comprised of the following: \u2022 Google Cloud Platform, which generates consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, and other services. These services provide access to solutions such as AI offerings including our AI infrastructure, Vertex AI platform, and Gemini for Google Cloud; cybersecurity; and data and analytics; \u2022 Google Workspace, which includes subscriptions for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for enterprises, such as Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Drive, and Meet, with integrated features like Gemini for Google Workspace; and \u2022 other enterprise services. Fluctuations in our Google Cloud revenues have been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition to the general factors described above, such as changes in customer usage and demand. Other Bets Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services, and internet services. Costs and Expenses Our cost structure has two components: cost of revenues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses include costs related to R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of our costs and expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. Additionally, fluctuations in employee compensation expenses may not directly correlate with changes in headcount, due to factors such as annual stock-based compensation (SBC) awards that generally vest over four years. Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues. \u2022 TAC includes: \u25e6 amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers; and \u25e6 amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties. \u2022 Other cost of revenues primarily includes: \u25e6 content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution, primarily related to YouTube (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated, subscriber counts, or a flat fee); \u25e6 depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure; \u25e6 employee compensation expenses related to our technical infrastructure and other operations such as content review and customer and product support; \u25e6 inventory and other costs related to the devices we sell; and \u25e6 other technical infrastructure operations costs, including network capacity, energy, and equipment costs.

The increase was due to increases in other cost of revenues and TAC of $3.2 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. The increase in TAC from the three months ended March 31, 2021 to the three months ended March 31, 2022 was due to increases in TAC paid to distribution partners and to Google Network partners, primarily driven by growth in revenues subject to TAC. The TAC rate increased from 21.7% to 21.9% from the three months ended March 31, 2021 to the three months ended March 31, 2022 due to a combination of factors none of which were individually significant. The TAC rate on Google Search & other properties revenues and the TAC rate on Google Network revenues were both substantially consistent from three months ended March 31, 2021 to the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase in other cost of revenues from the three months ended March 31, 2021 to the three months ended March 31, 2022 was primarily due to increases in data center and other operations costs, including depreciation expense, as well as content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube. Research and Development The following table presents R&D expenses (in millions, except percentages): Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 2022 Research and development expenses $ 7,485 $ 9,119 Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues 13.5 % 13.4 % R&D expenses increased $1.6 billion from the three months ended March 31, 2021 to the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation expenses of $944 million, largely resulting from a 14% increase in headcount. Sales and Marketing The following table presents sales and marketing expenses (in millions, except percentages): Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 2022 Sales and marketing expenses $ 4,516 $ 5,825 Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues 8.2 % 8.6 % Sales and marketing expenses increased $1.3 billion from the three months ended March 31, 2021 to the three months ended March 31, 2022 primarily driven by an increase in compensation expenses of $599 million and an increase in advertising and promotional activities of $494 million. The increase in compensation expenses was largely due to a 21% increase in headcount. The increase in advertising and promotional activities was driven by both increased spending in the current period and a reduction in spending in the prior year comparable period due to COVID-19.

Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based revenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression displayed to users. As our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues generated by the corresponding click and impression activity. Fluctuations in our advertising revenues, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search & other properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties and the correlation between these items have been and may continue to be affected by additional factors, such as: \u2022 advertiser competition for keywords; \u2022 changes in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy; \u2022 changes in device mix; \u2022 seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends, such as traditional retail seasonality; and \u2022 traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various verticals and channels.

The increase in TAC from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months ended March 31, 2024 was largely due to an increase in TAC paid to distribution partners, primarily driven by growth in revenues subject to TAC. The TAC rate decreased from 21.5% to 21.0% from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months ended March 31, 2024 primarily due to a revenue mix shift from Google Network properties to Google Search & other properties. The TAC rate on Google Search & other revenues was substantially consistent from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months ended March 31, 2024. The TAC rate on Google Network revenues reflected a slight increase from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months ended March 31, 2024 due to a combination of factors, none of which were individually significant. The increase in other cost of revenues from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months ended March 31, 2024 was primarily due to increases in content acquisition costs, largely for YouTube, and depreciation expense. These increases were partially offset by decreases in compensation expenses, largely the result of a reduction in employee severance and related charges of $308 million, and charges related to our office space optimization efforts of $220 million.

Additionally, a decrease in compensation expenses of $64 million was primarily the result of a reduction in employee severance and related charges of $588 million. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in SBC expense of $320 million, excluding employee severance and related charges.

        "text": "Costs and Expenses Our cost structure has two components: cost of revenues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses include costs related to R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of our costs and expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. Additionally, fluctuations in employee compensation expenses may not directly correlate with changes in headcount due to factors such as annual SBC awards that generally vest over four years. Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues. \u2022 TAC includes: \u25e6 amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers; and \u25e6 amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties. \u2022 Other cost of revenues primarily includes: \u25e6 content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution, primarily related to YouTube (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated, subscriber counts, or a flat fee); \u25e6 depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure; \u25e6 employee compensation expenses related to our technical infrastructure and other operations such as content review and customer and product support; \u25e6 inventory and other costs related to the devices we sell; and \u25e6 other technical infrastructure operations costs, including network capacity, energy, and equipment costs. TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly higher than TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search & other properties, because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners. Operating Expenses Operating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as either R&D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative. The main components of our R&D expenses are: \u2022 depreciation; \u2022 employee compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&D related to our existing and new products and services; and \u2022 third-party services fees primarily relating to consulting and outsourced services in support of our engineering and product development efforts. The main components of our sales and marketing expenses are: \u2022 employee compensation expenses for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain customer service functions; and \u2022 spend relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services. The main components of our general and administrative expenses are: \u2022 employee compensation expenses for employees in finance, human resources, information technology, legal, and other administrative support functions; \u2022 expenses relating to legal and other matters, including certain fines and settlements; and 34",

The overall growth was driven by interrelated factors including increases in search queries resulting from growth in user adoption and usage on mobile devices; growth in advertiser spending; and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery. YouTube ads YouTube ads revenues increased $837 million from the three months ended March 31, 2024 to the three months ended March 31, 2025. The growth was driven by our direct response advertising products followed by our brand advertising products, both of which benefited from increased spending by our advertisers. Google Network Google Network revenues decreased $157 million from the three months ended March 31, 2024 to the three months ended March 31, 2025, primarily due to the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates and a decrease in Google Ad Manager and AdMob revenues. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in AdSense revenues. Monetization Metrics The following table presents changes in monetization metrics for Google Search & other revenues (paid clicks and cost-per-click) and Google Network revenues (impressions and cost-per-impression), expressed as a percentage, from three months ended March 31, 2024 to three months ended March 31, 2025: Google Search & other Paid clicks change 2 % Cost-per-click change 7 % Google Network Impressions change (5) % Cost-per-impression change 4 % Changes in paid clicks and impressions are driven by a number of interrelated factors, including changes in advertiser spending; ongoing product and policy changes; and, as it relates to paid clicks, fluctuations in search queries resulting from changes in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices. Changes in cost-per-click and cost-per-impression are driven by a number of interrelated factors including changes in device mix, geographic mix, advertiser spending, ongoing product and policy changes, product mix, property mix, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues increased $1.6 billion from the three months ended March 31, 2024 to the three months ended March 31, 2025. The growth was primarily driven by an increase in subscription revenues. The increase in subscription revenues was primarily due to growth in the number of paid subscribers across both YouTube services and Google One. Google Cloud Google Cloud revenues increased $2.7 billion from the three months ended March 31, 2024 to the three months ended March 31, 2025 primarily driven by growth in Google Cloud Platform largely from infrastructure services. 37",

Use of Constant Currency Revenues and Constant Currency Revenue Percentage Change The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons. We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to understand our performance because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. We define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, and use it to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period. Constant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period revenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.

Fluctuations in our advertising revenues, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search & other properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties and the correlation between these items have been and may continue to be affected by additional factors, such as: \u2022 advertiser competition for keywords; \u2022 changes in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy; \u2022 changes in device mix; \u2022 seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends, such as traditional retail seasonality; and \u2022 traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various verticals and channels. Google Other Google other revenues are comprised of the following: \u2022 Google Play, which includes sales of apps and in-app purchases; \u2022 hardware, which includes sales of Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, and Pixel devices; \u2022 YouTube non-advertising, which includes subscription revenues from services such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV; and \u2022 other products and services. Fluctuations in our Google other revenues have been and may continue to be affected by additional factors, such as changes in customer usage and demand, number of subscribers, and fluctuations in the timing of product launches. Google Cloud Google Cloud revenues are comprised of the following: \u2022 Google Cloud Platform, which includes fees for infrastructure, platform, and other services; \u2022 Google Workspace, which includes fees for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for enterprises, such as Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar and Meet; and \u2022 other enterprise services. Fluctuations in our Google Cloud revenues have been and may continue to be affected by additional factors, such as customer usage. Other Bets Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services. Costs and Expenses Our cost structure has two components: cost of revenues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses include costs related to R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of our costs and expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. 34",

Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues. \u2022 TAC includes: \u25e6 Amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers. \u25e6 Amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties. \u2022 Other cost of revenues includes: \u25e6 Content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee). \u25e6 Expenses associated with our data centers (including bandwidth, compensation expenses, depreciation, energy, and other equipment costs) as well as other operations costs (such as content review as well as customer and product support costs). \u25e6 Inventory and other costs related to the hardware we sell. TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly higher than TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search & other properties, because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners. Operating Expenses Operating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as either R&D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative. The main components of our R&D expenses are: \u2022 compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&D related to our existing and new products and services; \u2022 depreciation; and \u2022 third-party services fees primarily relating to consulting and outsourced services in support of our engineering and product development efforts. The main components of our sales and marketing expenses are: \u2022 compensation expenses for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain customer service functions; and \u2022 spending relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services. The main components of our general and administrative expenses are: \u2022 compensation expenses for employees in finance, human resources, information technology, legal, and other administrative support functions; \u2022 expenses relating to legal matters, including fines and settlements; and \u2022 third-party services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and other outsourced administrative services. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net primarily consists of interest income (expense), the effect of foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net gains (losses) and impairment on our marketable and non-marketable securities, performance fees, and income (loss) and impairment from our equity method investments. For additional details, including how we account for our investments and factors that can drive fluctuations in the value of our investments, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 and Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for 35",

The increase in compensation expenses was largely due to an increase in SBC expenses of $471 million, which primarily reflects the reduction in valuation-based compensation liabilities related to certain Other Bets recognized in the prior year comparable period. R&D expenses increased $1.7 billion from the six months ended June 30, 2023 to the six months ended June 30, 2024, primarily driven by increases in depreciation expense of $640 million, compensation expenses of $522 million, and third-party services fees of $472 million. The increase in compensation expenses was primarily related to an increase in SBC expenses of $790 million, excluding employee severance and related charges, and reflects the reduction in valuation-based compensation liabilities related to certain Other Bets recognized in the prior year comparable period. The increase in compensation expenses is partially offset by a reduction in employee severance and related charges of $569 million.

        "text": "Costs and Expenses Our cost structure has two components: cost of revenues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses include costs related to R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of our costs and expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. Additionally, fluctuations in employee compensation expenses may not directly correlate with changes in headcount due to factors such as annual SBC awards that generally vest over four years. Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues. \u2022 TAC includes: \u25e6 amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers; and \u25e6 amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties. \u2022 Other cost of revenues primarily includes: \u25e6 content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution, primarily related to YouTube (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated, subscriber counts, or a flat fee); \u25e6 depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure; \u25e6 employee compensation expenses related to our technical infrastructure and other operations such as content review and customer and product support; \u25e6 inventory and other costs related to the devices we sell; and \u25e6 other technical infrastructure operations costs, including network capacity, energy, and equipment costs. TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly higher than TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search & other properties, because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners. Operating Expenses Operating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as either R&D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative. The main components of our R&D expenses are: \u2022 depreciation; \u2022 employee compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&D related to our existing and new products and services; and \u2022 third-party services fees primarily relating to consulting and outsourced services in support of our engineering and product development efforts. The main components of our sales and marketing expenses are: \u2022 employee compensation expenses for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain customer service functions; and \u2022 spend relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services. The main components of our general and administrative expenses are: \u2022 employee compensation expenses for employees in finance, human resources, information technology, legal, and other administrative support functions; \u2022 expenses relating to legal and other matters, including certain fines and settlements; and 39",

The increase in TAC from the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 was largely due to an increase in TAC paid to distribution partners, primarily driven by growth in revenues subject to TAC.

The TAC rate on Google Search & other revenues increased from the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 primarily due to increases related to mobile searches.

Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based revenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression displayed to users. As our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues generated by the corresponding click and impression activity. Fluctuations in our advertising revenues, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search & other properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties and the correlation between these items have been and may continue to be affected by additional factors, such as: \u2022 advertiser competition for keywords; \u2022 changes in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy; \u2022 changes in device mix; \u2022 seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends, such as traditional retail seasonality; and \u2022 traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various verticals and channels. Google Other Google other revenues are comprised of the following: \u2022 Google Play, which includes sales of apps and in-app purchases; \u2022 hardware, which includes sales of Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, and Pixel devices; \u2022 YouTube non-advertising, which includes subscription revenues from services such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV; and \u2022 other products and services. Fluctuations in our Google other revenues have been and may continue to be affected by additional factors, such as changes in customer usage and demand, number of subscribers, and fluctuations in the timing of product launches. Google Cloud Google Cloud revenues are comprised of the following: \u2022 Google Cloud Platform, which includes fees for infrastructure, platform, and other services; \u2022 Google Workspace, which includes fees for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for enterprises, such as Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar and Meet; and \u2022 other enterprise services. Fluctuations in our Google Cloud revenues have been and may continue to be affected by additional factors, such as customer usage. Other Bets Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services. Costs and Expenses Our cost structure has two components: cost of revenues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses include costs related to R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of our costs and expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. 35",

Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues. \u2022 TAC includes: \u25e6 Amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers. \u25e6 Amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties. \u2022 Other cost of revenues includes: \u25e6 Content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee). \u25e6 Expenses associated with our data centers (including bandwidth, compensation expenses, depreciation, energy, and other equipment costs) as well as other operations costs (such as content review as well as customer and product support costs). \u25e6 Inventory and other costs related to the hardware we sell. TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly higher than TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search & other properties, because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners. Operating Expenses Operating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as either R&D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative. The main components of our R&D expenses are: \u2022 compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&D related to our existing and new products and services; \u2022 depreciation; and \u2022 third-party services fees primarily relating to consulting and outsourced services in support of our engineering and product development efforts. The main components of our sales and marketing expenses are: \u2022 compensation expenses for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain customer service functions; and \u2022 spending relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services. The main components of our general and administrative expenses are: \u2022 compensation expenses for employees in finance, human resources, information technology, legal, and other administrative support functions; \u2022 expenses relating to legal matters, including fines and settlements; and \u2022 third-party services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and other outsourced administrative services.

The increase in other cost of revenues from the three months ended September 30, 2022 to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to increases in content acquisition costs, largely for YouTube. In addition, an overall increase in data center and other operations costs was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in the estimated useful lives of our servers and certain network equipment. The increase in other cost of revenues from the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to increases in content acquisition costs, largely for YouTube, and data center and other operations costs. The overall increase in data center and other operations costs includes $723 million of charges related to employee severance associated with the reduction of our workforce and our office space optimization efforts, partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in the estimated useful lives of our servers and certain network equipment.

The $375 million increase in compensation expenses was largely due to an increase in stock-based compensation. The $223 million increase in depreciation includes the benefit of the change in the estimated useful lives of our servers and network equipment. R&D expenses increased $4.1 billion from the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by increases in compensation expenses of $2.4 billion and depreciation of $517 million. The $2.4 billion increase in compensation expenses was the result of a 6% increase in average headcount, after adjusting for roles affected by the reduction in workforce, $847 million in employee severance charges associated with the reduction of our workforce, and an increase in stock-based compensation.

        "text": "Costs and Expenses Our cost structure has two components: cost of revenues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses include costs related to R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of our costs and expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. Additionally, fluctuations in compensation expenses may not directly correlate with changes in headcount, in particular due to annual SBC awards that generally vest over four years. Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues. \u2022 TAC includes: \u25e6 amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers; and \u25e6 amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties. \u2022 Other cost of revenues primarily includes: \u25e6 compensation expense related to our technical infrastructure and other operations such as content review and customer and product support; \u25e6 content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee); \u25e6 depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure; \u25e6 inventory and other costs related to the devices we sell; and \u25e6 other technical infrastructure operations costs, including bandwidth, energy, and equipment costs. TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly higher than TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search & other properties, because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners. Operating Expenses Operating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as either R&D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative. The main components of our R&D expenses are: \u2022 compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&D related to our existing and new products and services; \u2022 depreciation; and \u2022 third-party services fees primarily relating to consulting and outsourced services in support of our engineering and product development efforts. The main components of our sales and marketing expenses are: \u2022 compensation expenses for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain customer service functions; and \u2022 spending relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services. The main components of our general and administrative expenses are: \u2022 compensation expenses for employees in finance, human resources, information technology, legal, and other administrative support functions; \u2022 expenses relating to legal matters, including certain fines and settlements; and \u2022 third-party services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and other outsourced administrative services. 35",

The increase in TAC from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was largely due to an increase in TAC paid to distribution partners, primarily driven by growth in revenues subject to TAC.
