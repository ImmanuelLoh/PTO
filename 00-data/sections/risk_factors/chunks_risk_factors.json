We are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to\nsupport cloud computing services, invest in cybersecurity, and hire talent, particularly to support and scale our sales\nforce. At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services. Pricing and\ndelivery models are competitive and constantly evolving, and we may not attain sufficient scale and profitability to\nachieve our business objectives. Further, our business with public sector customers may present additional risks,\nincluding regulatory compliance risks. For instance, we may be subject to government audits and cost reviews, and\nany failure to comply or any deficiencies found may expose us to legal, financial, and/or reputational risks. Evolving\nlaws and regulations may require us to make new capital investments, build new products, and seek partners to deliver\nlocalized services in other countries, and we may not be able to meet sovereign operating requirements.\nWithin Other Bets, we are investing significantly in the areas of health, life sciences, and transportation, among\nothers. These investment areas face intense competition from large, experienced, and well-funded competitors, and\nour offerings, many of which involve the development of new and emerging technologies, may not be successful, or be\nable to compete effectively or operate at sufficient levels of profitability.\nIn addition, new and evolving products and services, including those that use AI, require significant investment\nand raise ethical, technological, legal, regulatory, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our brands and\ndemand for our products and services. Because all of these investment areas are inherently risky, no assurance can\nbe given that such strategies and offerings will be successful or will not harm our reputation, financial condition, and\noperating results.\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time, and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating\nmargin in the future.\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including changes in the\ndevices and modalities used to access our products and services; changes in geographic mix; deceleration or declines\nin advertiser spending; competition; customer usage and demand for our products; decreases in our pricing of our\nproducts and services; ongoing product and policy changes; and shifts to lower priced products and services.\nIn addition, we may also experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from a variety of\nfactors, such as the continued expansion of our business into new fields, including products and services such as\nhardware, Google Cloud, and subscription products, as well as significant investments in Other Bets, all of which may\nhave margins lower than those we generate from advertising. In particular, margins on our hardware products have\nhad, and may continue to have, an adverse affect on our consolidated margins due to pressures on pricing and higher\ncost of sales. We may also experience downward pressure on our operating margins from increasing regulations,\nincreasing competition, and increasing costs for many aspects of our business. Further, certain of our costs and\nexpenses are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. Additionally, in\nconjunction with our efforts to re-engineer costs, we may not be able to execute these efforts in a timely manner or\nthese efforts may not be successful. Due to these factors and the evolving nature of our business, our historical\nrevenue growth rate and historical operating margin may not be indicative of our future performance. For additional\ninformation, see Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect and Revenues and Monetization Metrics in Part II, Item 7\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of\nour products, services, and brands as well as affect our ability to compete.\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for\nus. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products,\nservices, and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country\nin which our products and services are distributed or made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have\ntaken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Although we seek to obtain patent protection\nfor our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Moreover, we may not have\nadequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. There is always the\npossibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or\nunenforceable.\nWe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy of such trade secrets and\nother sensitive information could be compromised, which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting\nfrom these trade secrets. We also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word\n\u201cGoogle\u201d could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word \u201csearch.\u201d Some courts have\nruled that \"Google\" is a protectable trademark, but it is possible that other courts, particularly those outside of the U.S.,\n11",

RISK FACTORS\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to\nthose described below, which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results, and affect\nthe trading price of our Class A and Class C stock.\nRisks Specific to our Company\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising. Reduced spending by advertisers, a\nloss of partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to customize\nads could harm our business.\nWe generated more than 75% of total revenues from online advertising in 2023. Many of our advertisers,\ncompanies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their\ncontracts with us at any time. These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value\n(such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more effective\nmonetization) than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practices, such as\nour initiatives to phase out third-party cookies, as well as changes to other companies\u2019 advertising and/or data privacy\npractices have in the past, and may in the future, affect the advertising that we are able to provide. In addition,\ntechnologies have been developed that make customized ads more difficult, or that block the display of ads altogether,\nand some providers of online services have integrated these technologies that could potentially impair the availability\nand functionality of third-party digital advertising. Failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively\nand competitively could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions. Adverse\nmacroeconomic conditions have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in\nfluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and\noperating results.\nWe face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that\nare useful to users, customers, and other partners, we may not remain competitive, which could harm our\nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. Our businesses face changing\ntechnologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete successfully,\nwe must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful products, services,\nand technologies in a timely manner. As our businesses evolve, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a\nwider range of products and services. We must continue to invest significant resources in technical infrastructure and\nR&D, including through acquisitions, in order to enhance our technology, products, and services.\nWe have many competitors in different industries. Our current and potential domestic and international\ncompetitors range from large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Some competitors have longer\noperating histories and well-established relationships in various sectors. They can use their experience and resources\nin ways that could affect our competitive position, including by making acquisitions and entering into other strategic\narrangements; continuing to invest heavily in technical infrastructure, R&D, and in talent; initiating intellectual property\nand competition claims (whether or not meritorious); and continuing to compete for users, advertisers, customers, and\ncontent providers. Further, discrepancies in enforcement of existing laws may enable our lesser known competitors to\naggressively interpret those laws without commensurate scrutiny, thereby affording them competitive advantages. Our\ncompetitors may also be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can or may foresee the\nneed for products and services before we do.\nWe are expanding our investment in AI across the entire company. This includes generative AI and continuing to\nintegrate AI capabilities into our products and services. AI technology and services are highly competitive, rapidly\nevolving, and require significant investment, including development and operational costs, to meet the changing needs\nand expectations of our existing users and attract new users. Our ability to deploy certain AI technologies critical for\nour products and services and for our business strategy may depend on the availability and pricing of third-party\nequipment and technical infrastructure. Additionally, other companies may develop AI products and technologies that\nare similar or superior to our technologies or more cost-effective to deploy. Other companies may also have (or in the\nfuture may obtain) patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit, or interfere with our ability to make, use,\nor sell our own AI products and services.\nOur financial condition and operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive to the\nevolving needs and desires of our users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. As new and\nexisting technologies continue to develop, competitors and new entrants may be able to offer experiences that are, or\n11.",

To make progress toward this effort, we aim to reduce 50% of our combined Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based),\nand Scope 3 absolute emissions (compared to our 2019 base year) by 2030, and we plan to invest in nature-based\nand technology-based carbon removal solutions to neutralize our remaining emissions.\nOur primary approach to reducing our Scope 2 emissions is through the procurement of carbon-free energy\n(CFE). In 2020, we set a goal to run on 24/7 CFE every hour of every day on every grid where we operate by 2030. In\n2023, we began implementing our carbon removals strategy, and we have begun establishing impactful partnerships\nand have started contracting for carbon removal credits.\nAchieving net-zero emissions and 24/7 CFE by 2030 are extremely ambitious goals. We also know that our path\nto net-zero emissions will not be easy or linear. Some of our plans may take years to deliver results, particularly where\nthey involve building new large-scale infrastructure with long lead times. Our approach will continue to evolve and will\nrequire us to navigate significant uncertainty, including the uncertainty around the future environmental impact of AI,\nwhich is complex and difficult to predict. In addition, solutions for some key global challenges do not currently exist,\nand will depend heavily on the development and improvement of new technologies by us and by the energy sector. As\nour business and industry continue to evolve, we expect our total GHG emissions to rise before dropping toward our\nabsolute emissions reduction target.\nFor additional information about risks and uncertainties applicable to our work on sustainability and efficiency, see\nItem 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCulture and Workforce\nWe are a company of curious, talented, and passionate people. We embrace collaboration and creativity, and\nencourage the iteration of ideas to address complex challenges in technology and society.\nOur people are critical for our continued success, so we work hard to create an environment where employees\ncan have fulfilling careers, and be happy, healthy, and perform at a high level. We offer industry-leading benefits and\nprograms to take care of the diverse needs of our employees and their families, including opportunities for career\ngrowth and development, resources to support their financial health, and access to excellent healthcare choices. Our\ncompetitive compensation programs help us to attract and retain key talent, and we will continue to invest in recruiting\ntalented people to technical and non-technical roles, and rewarding them well. We provide a variety of high quality\ntraining and support to managers to build and strengthen their capabilities-\u2013ranging from courses for new managers, to\nlearning resources that help them provide feedback and manage performance, to coaching and individual support.\nAs of December 31, 2024, Alphabet had 183,323 employees. We have work councils and statutory employee\nrepresentation obligations in certain countries, and we are committed to supporting protected labor rights, maintaining\nan open culture, and listening to all employees. Supporting healthy and open dialogue is central to how we work, and\nwe communicate information about the company through multiple internal channels to our employees.\nWhen appropriate we partner with outside companies on a contractual basis to provide a specialized service or to\ntemporarily cover a short-term need. The employees of our suppliers and staffing partners \u2014 vendors and temporary\nstaff, respectively \u2014 and independent contractors who are self-employed, make up our extended workforce. We\nchoose our partners and staffing agencies carefully, and review their compliance with Google\u2019s Supplier Code of\nConduct.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to numerous United States (U.S.) federal, state, and local, as well as foreign laws and regulations\ncovering a wide variety of subjects, and the scope of this coverage continues to broaden with continuing new legal and\nregulatory developments in the U.S. and internationally. Like other companies in the technology industry, we face\nincreasingly heightened scrutiny from both U.S. and foreign governments with respect to our compliance with laws and\n9.",

Our\ninvestments ultimately may not be commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital and, in\npursuing new strategies, we may incur unanticipated liabilities.\nWe have invested significantly and expect to continue to invest significantly in our property and equipment,\nincluding our technical infrastructure, and we expect these assets to benefit our business over their estimated useful\nlives. Changes in facts and circumstances such as changes to ongoing business operations, changes in the planned\nuse and utilization of assets, and/or technological advancements, could indicate a change in the period over which we\nexpect to benefit from the asset and impact our financial condition and operating results.\nInnovations in our products and services could also result in changes to user behavior and affect our revenue\ntrends. These endeavors involve significant risks and uncertainties, including diversion of resources and management\nattention from current operations, different monetization models, and the use of alternative investment, governance, or\ncompensation structures that may fail to adequately align incentives across the company or otherwise accomplish their\nobjectives.\nWithin Google Services, we continue to invest heavily in devices, including our smartphones, home devices, and\nwearables, which is a highly competitive market with frequent introduction of new products and services, rapid\nadoption of technological advancements by competitors, increased market saturation in developed countries, short\nproduct life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in performance characteristics, and price and\nfeature sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. There can be no assurance we will be able to provide\ndevices that compete effectively.\nWithin Google Cloud, we devote significant resources to develop and deploy our enterprise-ready cloud services,\nincluding Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, and we are advancing our AI platforms and models to\nsupport these tools and technologies. We are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud\ncomputing services, invest in cybersecurity, and hire talent, particularly to support and scale our sales force. At the\nsame time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services. Pricing, including platform\nswitching costs, are challenging across the industry, and delivery models are competitive and constantly evolving, and\nwe may therefore not achieve our business objectives. Further, our business with financial services, healthcare, and\npublic sector customers may present additional risks, including regulatory compliance risks. For instance, we may be\nsubject to government audits and cost reviews, and any failure to comply or any deficiencies found may expose us to\nlegal, financial, and/or reputational risks. Evolving laws and regulations may require us to make new capital\ninvestments, build new products, and seek partners to deliver localized services in other countries, and we may not be\nable to meet sovereign operating requirements.\nWithin Other Bets, we are investing significantly in areas such as health, life sciences, and transportation, among\nothers. These investment areas face intense competition from large, experienced, and well-funded competitors, and\nour offerings, many of which involve the development of new and emerging technologies, may not be successful, or be\nable to compete effectively or operate at sufficient levels of profitability.\nIn addition, new and evolving products and services, including those that use AI, raise ethical, technological,\nlegal, regulatory, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and\nservices. Because all of these investment areas are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies\nand offerings will be successful or will not harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time, and we may experience downward pressure on our\noperating margin in the future.\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including changes in the\ndevices and modalities used to access our products and services; changes in geographic mix; deceleration or declines\nin advertiser spending; competition; changes in customer usage and demand for our existing products and increasing\ndemand for new technologies; decreases in the pricing of our products and services; ongoing product and policy\nchanges; and shifts to lower priced products and services.\nIn addition, we may experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from a variety of factors,\nsuch as an increase in the mix of lower-margin products and services, in particular from the continued expansion of our\nbusiness into new fields, including products and services such as our devices, Google Cloud, and consumer\nsubscription products, as well as significant investments in Other Bets, all of which may have margins lower than those\nwe generate from advertising. In particular, margins on our devices have had, and may continue to have, an adverse\neffect on our consolidated margins due to pressures on pricing and higher cost of sales. We may also experience\ndownward pressure on our operating margins from increasing regulations, increasing competition, and increasing costs\n12.",

Some of the components we use in our technical\ninfrastructure and our devices are available from only one or limited sources, and we may not be able to find\nreplacement vendors on favorable terms in the event of a supply chain disruption. A significant supply interruption that\naffects us or our vendors could delay critical data center upgrades or expansions and delay consumer product\navailability.\nWe may enter into long-term contracts for materials and products that commit us to significant terms and\nconditions. We may face costs for materials and products that are not consumed due to market demand, technological\nchange, changed consumer preferences, quality, product recalls, and warranty issues. For instance, because certain of\nour hardware supply contracts have volume-based pricing or minimum purchase requirements, if the volume of sales\nof our devices decreases or does not reach projected targets, we could face increased materials and manufacturing\ncosts or other financial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit to manufacture and harm our\nfinancial condition and operating results. Furthermore, certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable\ncontractual terms based on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and\nmay affect our supply. For example, industry supply capacity for AI accelerators, including Graphics Processing Units,\nor GPUs, as well as our custom-built TPUs, is highly competitive and rapidly evolving. If we are unable to negotiate\nfavorable contractual terms or our competitors claim the supply or capacity first, we may face supply constraints.\nOur devices have had, and in the future may have, quality issues resulting from design, manufacturing, or\noperations. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or\nsuppliers. If the quality of our products and services does not meet expectations or our products or services are\ndefective or require a recall, it could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe require our suppliers and business partners to comply with laws and, where applicable, our company policies\nand practices, such as the Google Supplier Code of Conduct, regarding workplace and employment practices, data\nsecurity, environmental compliance, and intellectual property licensing, but we do not control them or their practices.\nViolations of law or unethical business practices could result in supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, harm to key\nrelationships, and damage to our reputation. Their failure to procure necessary license rights to intellectual property\ncould affect our ability to sell our products or services and expose us to litigation or financial claims.\nInterruption to, interference with, or failure of our complex information technology and communications\nsystems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services, which could harm our\nreputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nThe availability of our products and services and fulfillment of our customer contracts depend on the continuing\noperation of our information technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable to damage,\ninterference, or interruption from modifications or upgrades, terrorist attacks, state-sponsored attacks, natural disasters\nor pandemics, geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, export controls and sanctions, the effects of climate change\n(such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutdowns\nassociated with wildfire prevention, and increased storm severity), power and transmission availability challenges,\nutility outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, software bugs, cyber attacks, supply-chain attacks,\ncomputer denial of service attacks, phishing schemes, or other attempts to harm or access our systems. Some of our\ndata centers are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes or other natural disasters. Our data centers are\nalso subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism, and, in some cases, to potential disruptions\nresulting from problems experienced by facility operators or disruptions as a result of geopolitical tensions and conflicts\nhappening in the area. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and disaster recovery planning cannot account for\nall eventualities. The occurrence of a natural disaster or pandemic, closure of a facility, or other unanticipated problems\naffecting our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, our products and services are\nhighly technical and complex and have contained in the past, and may contain in the future, errors or vulnerabilities,\nwhich could result in interruptions in or failure of our services or systems. Any of these incidents could impede or\nprevent us from effectively offering products and providing services, which could harm our business, reputation,\nfinancial condition, and operating results.\nOur international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business, reputation,\nfinancial condition, and operating results.\n14.",

We expect to continue to devote significant resources to creating and\nsupporting products and services across multiple platforms and devices. Failing to attract and retain a substantial\nnumber of device manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, developers, and users, or failing to develop products and\ntechnologies that work well on new devices and platforms, could harm our business, financial condition, and operating\nresults and ability to capture future business opportunities.\nIssues in the development and use of AI may result in reputational harm and increased liability exposure.\nOur evolving AI-related efforts may give rise to risks related to harmful content, inaccuracies, discrimination,\nintellectual property infringement or misappropriation, violation of rights of publicity, defamation, data privacy,\ncybersecurity, and other issues. As a result of these and other challenges associated with innovative technologies, our\nimplementation of AI systems could subject us to competitive harm, regulatory action, legal liability (including under\nnew and proposed legislation and regulations), new applications of existing data protection, privacy, intellectual\nproperty, and other laws, and brand or reputational harm.\nSome uses of AI will present ethical issues and may have broad effects on society. In order to implement AI\nresponsibly and minimize unintended harmful effects, we have already devoted and will continue to invest significant\nresources to develop, test, and maintain our products and services, but we may not be able to identify or resolve all AI-\nrelated issues, deficiencies, and/or failures before they arise. Unintended consequences, uses, or customization of our\nAI tools and systems may negatively affect human rights, privacy, employment, or other social concerns, which may\nresult in claims, lawsuits, brand or reputational harm, and increased regulatory scrutiny, any of which could harm our\nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results.\nData privacy and security concerns relating to our technology and our practices could harm our\nreputation, cause us to incur significant liability, and deter current and potential users or customers from\nusing our products and services.

Our policies and practices may change over time as\nexpectations and regulations regarding privacy and data change.\nOur products and services involve the storage, handling, and transmission of proprietary and other sensitive\ninformation. Malicious software such as viruses, software bugs, theft, misuse, defects, vulnerabilities in our products\nand services, as well as cyber attacks, phishing schemes, and other types of security breaches expose us to a risk of\nloss or improper use and disclosure of such information, which could result in litigation and other potential liabilities,\nincluding regulatory fines and penalties, as well as reputational harm. Additionally, our products incorporate highly\ntechnical and complex technologies, and thus our technologies and software have contained, and are likely in the\nfuture to contain, undetected errors, bugs, and/or vulnerabilities. We continue to add new features involving AI to our\nofferings and internal systems, and features that rely on AI may be susceptible to unanticipated security threats as our\nand the market\u2019s understanding of AI-centric security risks and protection methods continue to develop. We have in the\npast discovered, and may in the future discover, some errors in our software code only after we have released the\ncode. Systems and control failures, security breaches, failure to comply with our privacy policies, and/or inadvertent\ndisclosure of user data could result in regulatory and legal exposure, seriously harm our reputation, brand, and\nbusiness, and impair our ability to attract and retain users or customers. Such incidents have occurred in the past and\nmay continue to occur due to the scale and nature of our products and services. While there is no guarantee that such\nincidents will not cause significant damage, we expect to continue to expend significant resources to maintain security\nprotections that limit the effect of bugs, theft, misuse, and security vulnerabilities or breaches.\nWe experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis.\nCyber attacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods\nof time. For example, the development and implementation of AI technologies may further increase our exposure to or\nexacerbate the risks of cyber attacks or other security incidents, particularly where such technologies are exploited by\nthird parties to breach our or other parties\u2019 systems, including when such technologies are used to target our\nemployees or impersonate members of senior management in order to gain unauthorized access to our systems. We\nhave also seen, and will continue to see, industry-wide software supply chain vulnerabilities, which could affect our or\nother parties\u2019 systems. We expect to continue to experience such incidents or vulnerabilities in the future. Our efforts to\nprevent security incidents and address undesirable activity on our platform may require us to spend additional\nresources to prepare and defend against such threats, and could also increase the risk of retaliatory attack.
