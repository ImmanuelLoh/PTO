Revenue Backlog As of December 31, 2022, we had $64.3 billion of remaining performance obligations (\u201crevenue backlog\u201d), primarily related to Google Cloud. Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenue. The amount and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services, which could affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when we expect to recognize such as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts. Deferred Revenue We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2021 was $3.8 billion, of which $2.5 billion was recognized as revenues for the year ending December 31, 2022. 59",

We expect to incur employee severance and related charges of $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion, the majority of which will be recognized in the first quarter of 2023. In addition, we are taking actions to optimize our global office space. As a result we expect to incur exit costs relating to office space reductions of approximately $0.5 billion in the first quarter of 2023. We may incur additional charges in the future as we further evaluate our real estate needs. 83",

Information about Segments and Geographic Areas We report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets: \u2022 Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Google Maps, Google Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; fees received for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket; the sale of apps and in-app purchases and devices. \u2022 Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from consumption-based fees and subscriptions received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services. \u2022 Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services. Revenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering activities, and devices, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the integrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are managed centrally at a consolidated level. These costs, including the associated depreciation and impairment, are allocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage, headcount, or revenue. Reflecting DeepMind's increasing collaboration with Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets, beginning in the first quarter of 2023 DeepMind is reported as part of Alphabet-level activities instead of within Other Bets. Additionally, beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we updated and simplified our cost allocation methodologies to provide our business leaders with increased transparency for decision-making. Prior periods have been recast to conform to the current presentation. As announced on April 20, 2023, we brought together part of Google Research (the Brain team) and DeepMind to significantly accelerate our progress in artificial intelligence (AI). The group, called Google DeepMind, is reported within Alphabet-level activities prospectively beginning in the second quarter of 2023. Previously, the Brain team was included within Google Services. Certain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs primarily include AI-focused shared R&D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; corporate initiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and legal costs, including certain fines and settlements. Charges associated with reductions in our workforce and office space during 2023 were not allocated to our segments. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are not allocated to our segments. Our operating segments are not evaluated using asset information.

Google Services Google Services operating income increased $6.2 billion from the three months ended June 30, 2023 to the three months ended June 30, 2024. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by an increase in revenues, partially offset by increases in content acquisition costs and TAC. Additionally, a reduction in compensation expenses contributed to the increase in operating income. Google Services operating income increased $12.4 billion from the six months ended June 30, 2023 to the six months ended June 30, 2024.

Google Cloud Google Cloud operating income increased $777 million and $1.5 billion from the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by an increase in revenues, partially offset by increases in usage costs for technical infrastructure assets as well as compensation expenses, largely driven by headcount growth. Other Bets Other Bets operating loss increased $321 million and $116 million from the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively. The increase in operating loss was primarily due to an increase in compensation expenses as a result of the reduction in valuation-based compensation liabilities related to certain Other Bets recognized in the prior year comparable period. Additionally, growth in revenues partially offset the increase in operating loss from the six months ended June 30, 2023 to the six months ended June 30, 2024. 42",

        "text": "\u2022 Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of autonomous transportation services, healthcare- related services and internet services. Revenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering activities, and devices, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the integrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are managed centrally at a consolidated level. These costs, including the associated depreciation, are allocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage, headcount, or revenue. Certain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs primarily include certain AI-focused shared R&D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; corporate initiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and legal costs, including certain fines and settlements. Charges associated with employee severance and office space reductions are also not allocated to our segments. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are not allocated to our segments. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is our Chief Executive Officer, Sundar Pichai. Our CODM uses segment operating income (loss) to allocate resources to our segments in our annual planning process and to assess the performance of our segments, primarily by monitoring actual results versus the annual plan. Our operating segments are not evaluated using asset information.

The growth was driven by our direct response advertising products followed by our brand advertising products, both of which benefited from increased spending by our advertisers. Google Network Google Network revenues decreased $90 million from the three months ended June 30, 2024 to the three months ended June 30, 2025, primarily due to a decrease in AdSense and Google Ad Manager revenues, partially offset by an increase in AdMob revenues. Google Network revenues decreased $247 million from the six months ended June 30, 2024 to the six months ended June 30, 2025, primarily due to a decrease in Google Ad Manager revenues and the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in AdSense revenues.

Changes in cost-per-click and cost-per-impression are driven by a number of interrelated factors including changes in device mix, geographic mix, advertiser spending, ongoing product and policy changes, product mix, property mix, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues increased $1.9 billion and $3.5 billion from the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2025. The growth was primarily driven by an increase in subscription revenues. This increase was primarily due to the contribution from growth in paid subscriptions across both YouTube services and Google One. Google Cloud Google Cloud revenues increased $3.3 billion and $6.0 billion from the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 primarily driven by growth in Google Cloud Platform largely from infrastructure services. 42",

Use of Non-GAAP Constant Currency Information International revenues, which represent a significant portion of our revenues, are generally transacted in multiple currencies and therefore are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons. We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period. Constant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period revenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP. 43",

The increase was primarily driven by an increase in compensation expenses of $385 million, largely resulting from a 23% increase in headcount, and an increase in professional services fees of $214 million. The overall increase was partially offset by a decrease in charges related to legal matters of $228 million, including the $217 million reduction of the EC fine imposed in 2018. For further details on the EC fine imposed in 2018, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Note 14. Information about Segments and Geographic Areas We report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets: \u2022 Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Google Maps, Google Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales of apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV. \u2022 Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues from fees received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services. \u2022 Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services. Revenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering activities, and hardware, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the integrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are managed centrally at a consolidated level. These costs, including the associated depreciation and impairment, are allocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage, headcount, or revenue. Reflecting DeepMind's increasing collaboration with Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets, beginning in the first quarter of 2023 DeepMind is reported as part of Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs instead of within Other Bets. Additionally, beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we updated and simplified our cost allocation methodologies to provide our business leaders with increased transparency for decision-making. Prior periods have been recast to conform to the current presentation. As announced on April 20, 2023, we brought together part of Google Research (the Brain team) and DeepMind to significantly accelerate our progress in artificial intelligence (AI).

Use of Non-GAAP Constant Currency Information International revenues, which represent a significant portion of our revenues, are generally transacted in multiple currencies and therefore are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons. We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period. Constant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period revenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP. 39",
