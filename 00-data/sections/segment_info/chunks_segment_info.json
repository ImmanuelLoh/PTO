Information about Segments and Geographic Areas\nWe report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:\n\u2022 Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Google Maps,\nGoogle Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; fees\nreceived for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and\nNFL Sunday Ticket; the sale of apps and in-app purchases and devices.\n\u2022 Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for\nenterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from consumption-based fees and\nsubscriptions received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and\ncollaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\n\u2022 Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from\nOther Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.\nRevenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering\nactivities, and devices, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the\nintegrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are\nmanaged centrally at a consolidated level. These costs, including the associated depreciation and impairment, are\nallocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage, headcount, or revenue.\nReflecting DeepMind's increasing collaboration with Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets, beginning in\nthe first quarter of 2023 DeepMind is reported as part of Alphabet-level activities instead of within Other Bets.\nAdditionally, beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we updated and simplified our cost allocation methodologies to\nprovide our business leaders with increased transparency for decision-making. Prior periods have been recast to\nconform to the current presentation.\nAs announced on April 20, 2023, we brought together part of Google Research (the Brain team) and DeepMind to\nsignificantly accelerate our progress in artificial intelligence (AI). The group, called Google DeepMind, is reported within\nAlphabet-level activities prospectively beginning in the second quarter of 2023. Previously, the Brain team was\nincluded within Google Services.\nCertain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs\nprimarily include AI-focused shared R&D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; corporate\ninitiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and\nlegal costs, including certain fines and settlements. Charges associated with reductions in our workforce and office\nspace during 2023 were not allocated to our segments. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are not\nallocated to our segments.\nOur operating segments are not evaluated using asset information.\nThe following table presents information about our segments (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021 2022 2023\nRevenues:\nGoogle Services $ 237,529 $ 253,528 $ 272,543\nGoogle Cloud 19,206 26,280 33,088\nOther Bets 753 1,068 1,527\nHedging gains (losses) 149 1,960 236\nTotal revenues $ 257,637 $ 282,836 $ 307,394\nOperating income (loss):\nGoogle Services $ 88,132 $ 82,699 $ 95,858\nGoogle Cloud (2,282) (1,922) 1,716\nOther Bets (4,051) (4,636) (4,095)\nAlphabet-level activities (3,085) (1,299) (9,186)\nTotal income from operations $ 78,714 $ 74,842 $ 84,293\nSee Note 2 for information relating to revenues by geography.\n86.",
