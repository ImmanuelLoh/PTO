This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android and when we launched Chrome, but those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer, popular browser. We continue to look toward the future and to invest for the long term within each of our segments. As we said in the original founders' letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in, as they are the key to our long-term success. The power of AI We believe that AI is a foundational and transformational technology that will provide compelling and helpful benefits to people and society through its capacity to assist, complement, empower, and inspire people in almost every field of human endeavor. As an information and computer science company, we will continue to be at the forefront of advancing the frontier of AI. Through our path-breaking and field-defining research and development, we responsibly and boldly develop more capable and useful AI every day. AI already powers Google\u2019s core products that help billions of people every day and has been at the foundation of our core ads quality systems for years, helping large and small businesses all over the world to produce and run effective and efficient ad campaigns that help grow their businesses. AI makes it possible to search in new languages, with multiple inputs, such as using images and text at the same time with the Google App. Some of our most popular products at Google \u2014 including Lens and Translate \u2014 were built entirely using artificial intelligence technologies such as optical character recognition and machine learning. Google Cloud continues to build AI into numerous solutions that our customers can use to develop AI-powered applications \u2014 including processing documents, images, and translation \u2014 to understand and analyze data more efficiently, and to use packaged solutions for a variety of industries. In all these examples, AI significantly enhances the usefulness and multiplies the value of these products and services to people and organizations. Our view is that AI is now, and more than ever, critical to delivering on our mission. As we bring our breakthrough AI innovations into the real world to assist people and benefit society everywhere, we are also pursuing further advancements that will help to unlock scientific discoveries and to tackle humanity's greatest challenges and opportunities. Privacy and security We make it a priority to protect the privacy and security of our products, users, and customers, even if there are near-term financial consequences. We do this by continuously investing in building products that are secure by default; strictly upholding responsible data practices that emphasize privacy by design; and building easy-to-use settings that put people in control. We are continually enhancing these efforts over time, whether",

Google For reporting purposes Google comprises two segments: Google Services and Google Cloud. Google Services Serving our users We have always been committed to building helpful products that can improve the lives of millions of people worldwide. Our product innovations are what make our services widely used, and our brand one of the most recognized in the world. Google Services' core products and platforms include ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Gmail, Google Drive, Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Play, Search, and YouTube, with broad and growing adoption by users around the world. Our products and services have come a long way since the company was founded more than two decades ago. Rather than the ten blue links in our early search results, users can now get direct answers to their questions using their computer or mobile device, their own voice, a photo, or an image, making it quicker, easier, and more natural to find what they are looking for. Of the searches we see every day, 15% are new. This drive to make information more accessible and helpful has led us over the years to improve the discovery and creation of digital content both on the web and through platforms like Google Play and YouTube.

We expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these markets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available. This trend could affect our revenues as developing markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets. International revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings. \u2022 The revenues that we derive from non-advertising products and services are increasing and may adversely affect our margins. Non-advertising revenues have grown over time, and we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our products and services. The margins on these revenues vary significantly and are generally lower than the margins on our advertising revenues. In particular margins on our hardware products adversely affect our consolidated margins due to pressures on pricing and higher cost of sales. \u2022 As we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and capital expenditures. We continue to make significant research and development investments in areas of strategic focus as we seek to develop new, innovative offerings and improve our existing offerings across our businesses. We also expect to continue to invest in our technical infrastructure, including servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term initiatives, in particular in support of AI. In addition acquisitions and strategic investments contribute to the breadth and depth of our offerings, expand our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, and build strong partnerships around strategic initiatives. For example, in September 2022 we closed the acquisition of Mandiant to help expand our offerings in dynamic cyber defense and response. \u2022 We face continuing changes in regulatory conditions, laws, and public policies, which could affect our business practices and financial results. Changes in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide range of topics and related legal matters have resulted in fines and caused us to change our business practices. As these global trends continue, our cost of doing business may increase, our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products or services may be limited, and we may need to change our business practices. Examples include the antitrust complaints filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and a number of state Attorneys General; pending litigation in the U.S., EU, and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for websites and online platforms; and the Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act in Europe and various legislative proposals in the U.S. focused on large technology platforms.

The increase in cost-per-impression from 2021 to 2022 was driven by a number of interrelated factors including ongoing product and policy changes, improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery, changes in device mix, geographic mix, product mix, and property mix, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates. Google other revenues Google other revenues increased $1.0 billion from 2021 to 2022 primarily driven by growth in YouTube non- advertising and hardware revenues, partially offset by a decrease in Google Play revenues. The growth in YouTube non-advertising was largely due to an increase in paid subscribers. The growth in hardware was primarily driven by increased sales of Pixel devices. The decrease in Google Play revenues was primarily driven by the fee structure changes we announced in 2021 as well as a decrease in buyer spending. Additionally, the overall increase in Google other revenues was adversely affected by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates. Google Cloud Google Cloud revenues increased $7.1 billion from 2021 to 2022. The growth was primarily driven by Google Cloud Platform followed by Google Workspace offerings.

Use of Non-GAAP Constant Currency Information International revenues, which represent a significant portion of our revenues, are generally transacted in multiple currencies and therefore are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons. We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) results helps improve the ability to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements (\"FX",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Google was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google. We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription- based products. Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Use of Estimates Preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; fair values of financial instruments, intangible assets, and goodwill; inventory; useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment; income taxes; and contingent liabilities, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable, and the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. In January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and adjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain network equipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate is effective beginning in fiscal year 2023. Stock Split Effected in the Form of a Stock Dividend (\u201cStock Split\u201d) On February 1, 2022, the company announced that the Board of Directors had approved and declared a 20-for- one stock split in the form of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the company\u2019s Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. The Stock Split had a record date of July 1, 2022 and an effective date of July 15, 2022. The par value per share of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock remains unchanged at $0.001 per share after the Stock Split. All prior period references made to share or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and applicable disclosures prior to the effective date have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split.

        "text": "Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. We offer advertising by delivering both performance and brand advertising. We recognize revenues for performance advertising when a user engages with the advertisement, such as a click, a view, or a purchase. For brand advertising, we recognize revenues when the ad is displayed, or a user views the ad. For ads placed on Google Network properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed on Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues, and amounts paid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of revenues. Where we are the principal, we control the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing. Google Cloud Revenues Google Cloud revenues consist of revenues from: \u2022 Google Cloud Platform, which includes fees for infrastructure, platform, and other services; \u2022 Google Workspace, which includes fees for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for enterprises, such as Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar, and Meet; and \u2022 other enterprise services. Our cloud services are generally provided on either a consumption or subscription basis and may have contract terms longer than a year. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis are recognized when the customer utilizes the services, based on the quantity of services consumed. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the cloud services. Google Other Revenues Google other revenues consist of revenues from: \u2022 Google Play, which includes sales of apps and in-app purchases; \u2022 hardware, which includes sales of Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, and Pixel devices; \u2022 YouTube non-advertising, which includes subscription revenues from services such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV; and \u2022 other products and services. We report revenues from Google Play app sales and in-app purchases on a net basis, because our performance obligation is to facilitate a transaction between app developers and end users, for which we earn a service fee. Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations Our contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate revenues to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers. Customer Incentives and Credits Certain customers receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration. Sales",

Revenue Backlog As of December 31, 2022, we had $64.3 billion of remaining performance obligations (\u201crevenue backlog\u201d), primarily related to Google Cloud. Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenue. The amount and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services, which could affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when we expect to recognize such as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts. Deferred Revenue We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2021 was $3.8 billion, of which $2.5 billion was recognized as revenues for the year ending December 31, 2022. 59",

Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $3.8 billion, $5.2 billion, and $7.1 billion as of December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively, of which $2.6 billion, $3.7 billion, and $5.3 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, we accrued $270 million and $346 million in interest and penalties in provision for income taxes, respectively. We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. Our two major tax jurisdictions are the U.S. federal and Ireland. We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. The IRS is currently examining our 2016 through 2018 tax returns. We have also received tax assessments in multiple foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or permanent establishment. We continue to defend any and all such claims as presented. The tax years 2015 through 2021 remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Irish tax purposes. There are other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statements. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the effect, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions. We believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolutions occur. Although the timing of resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is not certain, it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits from certain U.S. federal, state, and non U.S. tax positions could decrease by approximately $1.8 billion in the next 12 months. Positions that may be resolved include various U.S. and non-U.S. matters. Note 15.

For additional information on our segments, see Part I, Item 1 Business and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect The following long-term trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate that they will continue to affect our future results: \u2022 Users' behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves. The continuing evolution of the online world has contributed to the growth of our business and our revenues since inception. We expect that this evolution will continue to benefit our business and our revenues, although at a slower pace than we have experienced historically, in particular after the outsized growth in our advertising revenues during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we face increasing competition for user engagement and advertisers, which may affect our revenues. \u2022 Users continue to access our products and services using diverse devices and modalities, which allows for new advertising formats that may benefit our revenues but adversely affect our margins. Our users are accessing our products and services via diverse devices and modalities, such as smartphones, wearables, connected TVs, and smart home devices, and want to be able to be connected no matter where they are or what they are doing. We are focused on expanding our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to maintain and grow our business. We benefit from advertising revenues generated from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising formats. The margins from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional desktop search. Additionally, as the market for a particular device type or modality matures, our advertising revenues may be affected. For example, changing dynamics within the global smartphone market, such as increased market saturation in developed countries, can affect our mobile advertising revenues. We expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our revenues grow and TAC as a percentage of our advertising revenues (\"TAC rate\") to",

We expect these trends to continue to affect our revenues and put pressure on our margins. \u2022 As online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings, which may affect our monetization. As interactions between users and advertisers change, and as online user behavior evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings to serve these changing needs, which may affect our monetization. For example, revenues from ads on YouTube and Google Play monetize at a lower rate than our traditional search ads. We also expect to continue to incorporate AI innovations into our products, such as AI in Search, that could affect our monetization trends. When developing new products and services we generally focus first on user experience and then on monetization. \u2022 As users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets continue to increase, and may require continued investments. In addition, movements in foreign exchange rates affect such revenues. 29.",

The shift to online, as well as the advent of the multi-device world, has brought opportunities outside of the U.S., including in emerging markets, such as India. We continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our products and advertising programs relevant to our users in these markets. This has led to a trend of increased revenues from emerging markets. We expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these markets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available. This trend could affect our revenues as developing markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets. International revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings. \u2022 The revenues that we derive beyond advertising are increasing and may adversely affect our margins. Revenues from cloud, consumer subscriptions, platforms, and devices, which may have differing characteristics than our advertising revenues, have grown over time, and we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our products and services. The margins on these revenues vary significantly and are generally lower than the margins on our advertising revenues. For example, sales of our devices adversely affect our consolidated margins due to pressures on pricing and higher cost of sales. \u2022 As we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and capital expenditures. We continue to make significant research and development investments in areas of strategic focus as we seek to develop new, innovative offerings, improve our existing offerings, and rapidly and responsibly deploy AI across our businesses. We also expect to increase, relative to 2023, our investment in our technical infrastructure, including servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term initiatives, in particular in support of AI products and services. In addition, acquisitions and strategic investments contribute to the breadth and depth of our offerings, expand our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, and build strong partnerships around strategic initiatives. \u2022 We continue to face an evolving regulatory environment, and we are subject to claims, lawsuits, investigations, and other forms of potential legal liability, which could affect our business practices and financial results. Changes in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide range of topics and related legal matters, including investigations, lawsuits, and regulatory actions, have resulted in fines and caused us to change our business practices. As these global trends continue, our cost of doing business may increase, our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products or services may be limited, and we may need to change our business practices to comply with evolving regulatory",

The increase in compensation expenses included charges related to employee severance associated with the reduction in our workforce. Additionally, cost of revenues benefited from a reduction in depreciation due to the change in estimated useful lives of our servers and network equipment. \u2022 Operating expenses were $89.8 billion, an increase of 10% year over year, primarily driven by an increase in compensation expenses and charges related to our office space optimization efforts. The increase in compensation expenses was largely the result of charges related to employee severance associated with the reduction in our workforce and an increase in SBC expense. Operating expenses benefited from the change in the estimated useful lives of our servers and certain network equipment. Other Information: \u2022 In January 2023, we announced a reduction of our workforce, and as a result we recorded employee severance and related charges of $2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition, we are taking actions to optimize our global office space. As a result, exit charges recorded during the year ended December 31, 2023, were $1.8 billion. In addition to these exit charges, for the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred $269 million in accelerated rent and accelerated depreciation. For additional information, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \u2022 In January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment, resulting in a change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment to six years.

Changes in cost-per-click and cost-per-impression are driven by a number of interrelated factors including changes in device mix, geographic mix, advertiser spending, ongoing product and policy changes, product mix, property mix, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues increased $5.6 billion from 2022 to 2023 primarily driven by growth in subscriptions, largely for YouTube services. The growth in YouTube services was primarily due to an increase in paid subscribers. Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues increased $1.0 billion from 2021 to 2022 primarily driven by growth in subscription and device revenues, partially offset by a decrease in platform revenues. The growth in subscriptions was largely for YouTube services, primarily due to an increase in paid subscribers. The growth in device revenues was primarily driven by increased sales of Pixel devices. The decrease in platform revenues was primarily due to Google Play, driven by the fee structure changes we announced in 2021 as well as a decrease in buyer spending. Additionally, the overall increase in Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues was adversely affected by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates. Google Cloud Google Cloud revenues increased $6.8 billion from 2022 to 2023. Growth was primarily driven by Google Cloud Platform followed by Google Workspace offerings.

Use of Non-GAAP Constant Currency Information International revenues, which represent a significant portion of our revenues, are generally transacted in multiple currencies and therefore are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons. We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) results helps improve the ability to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period. Constant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period revenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Google was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google. We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for consumer subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and devices. Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Use of Estimates Preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; content licenses; contingent liabilities; fair values of financial instruments and goodwill; income taxes; inventory; and useful lives of property and equipment, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable, and the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. In January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and adjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain network equipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December 31, 2022, and those placed in service during the year ended December 31, 2023, the effect of this change in estimate was a reduction in depreciation expense of $3.9 billion and an increase in net income of $3.0 billion, or $0.24 per basic and $0.24 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2023. Revenue Recognition Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, and the collectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or services is probable. Sales and other similar taxes are excluded from revenues. Advertising Revenues We generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on: \u2022 Google Search and other properties, including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play; \u2022 YouTube properties; and \u2022 Google Network properties, including revenues from Google Network properties participating in",

Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing. Google Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues consist of revenues from: \u2022 consumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One; \u2022 platforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play from the sales of apps and in-app purchases; \u2022 devices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices; and \u2022 other products and services. Subscription revenues are recognized ratably over the period of the subscription, primarily monthly. We report revenues from Google Play app sales and in-app purchases on a net basis, because our performance obligation is to facilitate a transaction between app developers and end users, for which we earn a service fee. Google Cloud Revenues Google Cloud revenues consist of revenues from: \u2022 Google Cloud Platform, which generates consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, and other services. These services provide access to solutions such as cybersecurity, databases, analytics, and AI offerings including our AI infrastructure, Vertex AI platform, and Duet AI for Google Cloud; \u2022 Google Workspace, which includes subscriptions for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for enterprises, such as Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Drive, and Meet, with integrated features like Duet AI in Google Workspace; and \u2022 other enterprise services. Our cloud services are generally provided on either a consumption or subscription basis and may have contract terms longer than a year. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis are recognized when the customer utilizes the services, based on the quantity of services consumed. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the cloud services. Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations Our contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate revenues to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers. Customer Incentives and Credits Certain customers receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration. Sales Commissions We expense sales commissions when incurred when the period of the expected benefit is one year or less. We recognize an asset for certain sales commissions and amortize if the expected benefit period is greater than one",

Revenue Backlog As of December 31, 2023, we had $74.1 billion of remaining performance obligations (\u201crevenue backlog\u201d), primarily related to Google Cloud. Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenue. The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts. Deferred Revenues We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2022 was $4.5 billion, of which $2.4 billion was recognized as revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023. Note 3.

Working with content creators and partners, we continue to build new ways for people around the world to create and find great digital content. Fueling all of these great digital experiences are extraordinary platforms and devices. That is why we continue to invest in platforms like our Android mobile operating system, Chrome browser, and Chrome operating system, as well as our family of devices. We see tremendous potential for devices to be helpful and make people's lives easier by combining the best of our AI, software, and hardware. This potential is reflected in our latest generation of devices, such as the new Pixel 9 series and the Pixel Watch 3. Creating products and services that people rely on every day is a journey that we are investing in for the long-term. How We Make Money We have built world-class advertising technologies for advertisers, agencies, and publishers to power their digital marketing businesses. Our advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses through our wide range of products across devices and formats, and we aim to ensure positive user experiences by serving the right ads at the right time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies. AI has been foundational to our advertising business for more than a decade. Products like Demand Gen, Performance Max, and Product Studio use the full power of our AI to help advertisers find untapped and incremental conversion opportunities. Google Services generates revenues primarily by delivering both performance and brand advertising that appears on Google Search & other properties, YouTube, and Google Network partners' properties (\"Google Network properties\"). We continue to invest in both performance and brand advertising and seek to improve the measurability of advertising so advertisers understand the effectiveness of their campaigns. \u2022 Performance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click on leading to direct engagement with advertisers. Performance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while driving measurable results. Our ads tools allow performance advertisers to create simple text-based ads. \u2022 Brand advertising helps enhance users' awareness of and affinity for advertisers' products and services, through videos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across various devices. We help brand advertisers deliver digital videos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their brand-building marketing campaigns. We have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web. We focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways, including filtering out invalid traffic, removing billions of bad ads from our systems every year, and closely monitoring the sites, apps, and videos where ads appear and blocklisting them when necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content.

The following section generally discusses 2024 results compared to 2023 results. Discussion of 2023 results compared to 2022 results to the extent not included in this report can be found in Item 7 of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Understanding Alphabet\u2019s Financial Results Alphabet is a collection of businesses \u2014 the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, Google Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For further details on our segments, see Part I, Item 1 Business and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect The following long-term trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate that they will continue to affect our future results: \u2022 Users' behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves. The continuing evolution of the online world has contributed to the growth of our business and our revenues since inception. We expect that this evolution will continue to benefit our business and our revenues, although at a slower pace than we have experienced historically. In addition, we face increasing competition for user engagement and advertisers, including from other developers and providers of AI products and services, which may affect our revenues. \u2022 Users continue to access our products and services using diverse devices and modalities, which allows for new advertising formats that may benefit our revenues but adversely affect our margins. Our users are accessing our products and services via diverse devices and modalities beyond traditional desktop, such as smartphones, wearables, connected TVs, and smart home devices, and want to be able to be connected no matter where they are or what they are doing. We are focused on expanding our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to maintain and grow our business. We benefit from advertising revenues generated from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising formats. The margins from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional desktop search. Additionally, as the market for a particular device type or modality matures, our advertising revenues may be affected. For example, changing dynamics within the global smartphone market, such as increased market saturation in developed countries, can affect our mobile advertising revenues. We expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our revenues grow and TAC as a percentage of our advertising revenues (\"TAC rate\") to",

We expect these trends to continue to affect our revenues and put pressure on our margins. \u2022 As online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings, which may affect our monetization. As interactions between users and advertisers change, and as online user behavior evolves, for example with AI, we continue to expand our product offerings to serve these changing needs, which may affect monetization of our products and services. We expect to continue to incorporate AI innovations into our products, such as AI in Search, that could affect our monetization trends. When developing new products and services we generally focus first on user experience and then on monetization. \u2022 As users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets continue to increase, and may require continued investments. In addition, movements in foreign exchange rates affect such revenues. The shift to online, as well as the advent of the multi-device world, has brought opportunities outside of the U.S., including in emerging markets, such as India. We continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our products and advertising programs relevant to our users in these markets. This has led to a trend of increased 30.",

We expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these markets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available. This trend could affect our revenues as developing markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets. International revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings. \u2022 The revenues that we derive beyond advertising are increasing and may adversely affect our margins. Revenues from cloud, consumer subscriptions, platforms, and devices, which may have differing characteristics than our advertising revenues, have grown over time, and we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our products and services. The margins on these revenues vary significantly and are generally lower than the margins on our advertising revenues. For example, sales of our devices adversely affect our consolidated margins due to pressures on pricing and higher cost of sales. \u2022 As we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and capital expenditures. We continue to make significant research and development investments in areas of strategic focus as we seek to develop new, innovative offerings, improve our existing offerings, and rapidly and responsibly deploy AI across our businesses. We also expect to increase, relative to 2024, our investment in our technical infrastructure, including servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term initiatives, in particular in support of AI products and services. In addition, acquisitions and strategic investments remain important elements in our use of capital and contribute to the breadth and depth of our offerings, expand our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, and build strong partnerships around strategic initiatives. \u2022 We continue to face an evolving regulatory environment, and we are subject to claims, lawsuits, investigations, and other forms of potential legal liability, which could affect our business practices and financial results. Changes in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide range of topics and related legal matters, including investigations, lawsuits, and regulatory actions, have resulted in fines and caused us to change our business practices. As these global trends continue, our cost of doing business may increase, our products and services may become less useful, our ability to pursue certain business practices or offer certain products or services may be limited, and we may need to change our business models and operations to comply with evolving regulatory and legal matters.

These increases were partially offset by reductions in charges related to legal and other matters and charges related to our office space optimization efforts. The overall increase in employee compensation expenses was partially offset by a reduction in employee severance and related charges.

Use of Non-GAAP Constant Currency Information International revenues, which represent a significant portion of our revenues, are generally transacted in multiple currencies and therefore are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons. We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) results helps improve the ability to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period. Constant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period revenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP. 37.",

We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure, platform services, and applications; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and devices. Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Use of Estimates Preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; contingent liabilities; fair values of financial instruments and goodwill; income taxes; inventory; and useful lives of property and equipment, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable, and the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Revenue Recognition Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, and the collectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or services is probable. Sales and other similar taxes are excluded from revenues. Advertising Revenues We generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on: \u2022 Google Search and other properties, including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play; \u2022 YouTube properties; and \u2022 Google Network properties, including revenues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Our customers generally purchase advertising inventory through Google Ads, Google Ad Manager, Google Display & Video 360, and Google Marketing Platform, among others. We offer advertising by delivering both performance and brand advertising. We recognize revenues for performance advertising when a user engages with the advertisement. For brand advertising, we recognize revenues when the ad is displayed, or a user views the ad. For ads placed on Google Network properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed on Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues, and amounts paid to Google Network partners",

Subscription revenues are recognized ratably over the period of the subscription, primarily monthly. We report revenues from Google Play sales of apps and in-app purchases on a net basis because our performance obligation is to facilitate a transaction between app developers and end users for which we earn a service fee. Google Cloud Revenues Google Cloud revenues consist of revenues from: \u2022 Google Cloud Platform, which generates consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, and other services. These services provide access to solutions such as AI offerings including our AI infrastructure, Vertex AI platform, and Gemini for Google Cloud; cybersecurity; and data and analytics; \u2022 Google Workspace, which includes subscriptions for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for enterprises, such as Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Drive, and Meet, with integrated features like Gemini for Google Workspace; and \u2022 other enterprise services. Our cloud services are generally provided on either a consumption or subscription basis and may have contract terms longer than a year. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis are recognized when the customer utilizes the services, based on the quantity of services consumed. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the cloud services. Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations Our contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate revenues to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers. Customer Incentives and Credits Certain customers receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration related to customer incentives and credits. Sales Commissions We expense sales commissions when incurred when the period of the expected benefit is one year or less. We recognize an asset for certain sales commissions and amortize if the expected benefit period is greater than one year. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses. Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues consists of TAC and other costs of revenues. \u2022 TAC includes: \u25e6 amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers; and \u25e6 amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties. \u2022 Other cost of revenues includes: \u25e6 content acquisition",

Revenue Backlog As of December 31, 2024, we had $93.2 billion of remaining performance obligations (\u201crevenue backlog\u201d), primarily related to Google Cloud. Revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months with the remainder to be recognized thereafter. The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts. Deferred Revenues We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2023 was $5.0 billion, of which $3.9 billion was recognized as revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $7.1 billion, $9.4 billion, and $12.6 billion as of December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively, of which $5.3 billion, $7.4 billion, and $10.0 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, we accrued $622 million and $1.1 billion in interest and penalties in provision for income taxes, respectively. We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. Our two major tax jurisdictions are the U.S. federal and Ireland. We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. The IRS is currently examining our 2016 through 2021 tax returns. We have also received tax assessments in multiple foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or permanent establishment. We continue to defend such claims as presented. The tax years 2016 through 2023 remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Irish tax purposes. There are other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statements. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the effect, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions. We believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolutions occur. Although the timing of resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is not certain, we do not believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits from certain U.S. federal, state, and non U.S. tax positions will materially change in the next 12 months.

Financial Instruments Debt Securities We classify our marketable debt securities, which are accounted for as available-for-sale, within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy because we use quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine fair value. For certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in other income (expense), net. The fair value option was elected for these securities to align with the unrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts. Unrealized net losses related to debt securities still held where we have elected the fair value option were $35 million and $236 million as of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, the fair value of these debt securities was $4.7 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively.

We report Google in two segments, Google Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Other Bets include earlier stage technologies that are further afield from our core Google business. For further details on our segments, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Seasonality and other Our advertising revenues are affected by seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends, such as traditional retail seasonality. Additionally, our non-advertising revenues, including those generated from Google Cloud, Google Play, hardware, and YouTube, may be affected by fluctuations driven by changes in pricing, digital content releases, fee structures, new product and service launches, and other market dynamics, as well as seasonality. Revenues and Monetization Metrics Google Services Google Services revenues consist of revenues generated from advertising (\u201cGoogle advertising\u201d) as well as revenues from other sources (\u201cGoogle other revenues\u201d). Google Advertising Google advertising revenues are comprised of the following: \u2022 Google Search & other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play; \u2022 YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and \u2022 Google Network, which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. We use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our advertising revenues: paid clicks and cost-per-click pertain to traffic on Google Search & other properties, while impressions and cost-per-impressions pertain to traffic on our Network partners\u2019 properties. Paid clicks represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users on Google search properties and other Google owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play. Cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users. Impressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based revenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression displayed to users.

Costs and Expenses Our cost structure has two components: cost of revenues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses include costs related to R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of these expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to the changes in revenue. Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues. \u2022 TAC includes: \u25e6 Amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers. \u25e6 Amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties. \u2022 Other cost of revenues includes: \u25e6 Content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee). 31",

The cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly higher than the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search & other properties, because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners. Operating Expenses Operating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as either R&D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative. The main components of our R&D expenses are: \u2022 compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&D related to our existing and new products and services; \u2022 depreciation; and \u2022 professional services fees primarily related to consulting and outsourcing services. The main components of our sales and marketing expenses are: \u2022 compensation expenses for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain customer service functions; and \u2022 spending relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services.

Other information \u2022 During the first quarter of 2022, we suspended the vast majority of our commercial activities in Russia and effectively ceased business activities of our Russian entity. These direct actions did not have a material effect on our financial results. The ongoing broader economic effects resulting from the war in Ukraine on our future financial results may be unpredictable. \u2022 We entered into an agreement to acquire Mandiant, a leader in dynamic cyber defense and response, in March 2022 for $23.00 per share, in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $5.4 billion, net of cash and debt. See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. \u2022 Repurchases of Class A and Class C shares were $13.3 billion. In April 2022, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. \u2022 The company announced in February 2022 that the Board of Directors had approved and declared a 20-for- one stock split in the form of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the company\u2019s Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. \u2022 Operating cash flow was $25.1 billion, primarily driven by revenues generated from our advertising products. \u2022 Capital expenditures of $9.8 billion",

The increase in cost-per-click from the three months ended March 31, 2021 to the three months ended March 31, 2022 was driven by a number of interrelated factors including changes in device mix, geographic mix, growth in advertiser spending, ongoing product changes, and property mix. Impressions and cost-per-impression The following table presents year-over-year changes in impressions and cost-per-impression (expressed as a percentage): Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 Impressions change 5% Cost-per-impression change 17% Impressions increased from the three months ended March 31, 2021 to the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily driven by growth in Google Ad Manager and AdMob. The increase in cost-per-impression from the three months ended March 31, 2021 to the three months ended March 31, 2022 was driven by a number of interrelated factors including ongoing product and policy changes, improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery, changes in device mix, geographic mix, product mix, and property mix. Google other revenues Google other revenues increased $317 million from the three months ended March 31, 2021 to the three months ended March 31, 2022. The growth was primarily driven by YouTube non-advertising, largely due to an increase in paid subscribers. The overall growth was partially offset by a decline in Google Play revenues largely driven by fee structure changes we announced in 2021. Google Cloud Google Cloud revenues increased $1.8 billion from the three months ended March 31, 2021 to the three months ended March 31, 2022. The growth was primarily driven by GCP followed by Google Workspace offerings. Google Cloud's infrastructure and platform services were the largest drivers of growth in GCP.

Use of Constant Currency Revenues and Constant Currency Revenue Percentage Change The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons. We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to understand our performance because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. We define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, and use it to determine the constant currency revenue percentage",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Google was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google. We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products. Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Unaudited Interim Financial Information These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2023. We have made estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. These consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the SEC. Change in Accounting Estimate In January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and adjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain network equipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December 31, 2022, and those placed in service during the quarter ended March 31, 2023, the effect of this change in estimate was a reduction in depreciation expense of $988 million and an increase in net income of $770 million, or $0.06 per basic and $0.06 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Stock Split Effected in the Form of a Stock Dividend (\u201cStock Split\u201d) On July 15, 2022, we executed a 20-for-one stock split of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. All prior period references made to share or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and applicable disclosures prior to the effective date have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split. Prior Period Reclassifications Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation. 10",

Revenue Backlog As of March 31, 2023, we had $61.7 billion of remaining performance obligations (\u201crevenue backlog\u201d), primarily related to Google Cloud. Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenue. The amount and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services, which could affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when we expect to recognize such as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts. Deferred Revenues We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2022 was $4.5 billion, of which $1.6 billion was recognized as revenues during the three months ended March 31, 2023. 11",

For certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us and their creditors do not have recourse to us. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $4.1 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs were $2.6 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively.

We report Google in two segments, Google Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For further details on our segments, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Revenues and Monetization Metrics We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products. For details on how we recognize revenue, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. In addition to the long-term trends and their financial effect on our business noted in \"Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect\" in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, fluctuations in our revenues have been and may continue to be affected by a combination of factors, including: \u2022 changes in foreign currency exchange rates; \u2022 changes in pricing, such as those resulting from changes in fee structures, discounts, and customer incentives; \u2022 general economic conditions and various external dynamics, including geopolitical events, regulations, and other measures and their effect on advertiser, consumer, and enterprise spending; \u2022 new product and service launches; and \u2022 seasonality. Additionally, fluctuations in our revenues generated from advertising (\"Google advertising\"), revenues from other sources (\"Google other revenues\"), Google Cloud, and Other Bets revenues have been and may continue to be affected by other factors unique to each set of revenues, as described below. Google Services Google Services revenues consist of Google advertising as well as Google other revenues. Google Advertising Google advertising revenues are comprised of the following: \u2022 Google Search & other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play; \u2022 YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and \u2022 Google Network, which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad",

Other Information \u2022 In January 2023, we announced a reduction of our workforce, and as a result in the first quarter of 2023 we recorded employee severance and related charges of $2.0 billion, representing the majority of expected costs associated with this action. In addition, we are taking actions to optimize our global office space, and as a result we recorded charges related to office",

The effect of this change was a reduction in depreciation expense of $988 million for the first quarter of 2023, recognized primarily in cost of revenues and R&D expenses. For additional information, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. \u2022 Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, our segment reporting reflects two changes: (i) DeepMind, previously reported within Other Bets, is reported as part of Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs, and (ii) we updated and simplified our cost allocation methodologies to provide our business leaders with increased transparency for decision-making. Prior periods have been recast to conform to the current presentation. For additional information, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. \u2022 Beginning in 2023, the timing of our annual employee stock-based compensation awards shifted from January to March. While the shift in timing itself will not affect the amount of stock-based compensation expense over the full fiscal year 2023, it results in relatively less expense recognized in the first quarter compared to the remaining quarters of the year. \u2022 Repurchases of Class A and Class C shares were $15.1 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. \u2022 Operating cash flow was $23.5 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023. \u2022 Capital expenditures, which primarily reflected investments in technical infrastructure, were $6.3 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023. \u2022 As of March 31, 2023, we had 190,711 employees, which includes almost all of the employees affected by the reduction of our workforce. We expect most of those affected will no longer be reflected in our headcount by the end of the second quarter of 2023, subject to local law and consultation requirements. 34",

The decrease in cost-per-impression from the three months ended March 31, 2022 to the three months ended March 31, 2023 was driven by a number of interrelated factors including ongoing product and policy changes, changes in device mix, geographic mix, product mix, and property mix, as well as the adverse effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Google other revenues Google other revenues increased $602 million from the three months ended March 31, 2022 to the three months ended March 31, 2023 primarily driven by growth in YouTube non-advertising, largely due to an increase in paid subscribers. Growth was adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Google Cloud Google Cloud revenues increased $1.6 billion from the three months ended March 31, 2022 to the three months ended March 31, 2023. Growth was primarily driven by Google Cloud Platform followed by Google Workspace offerings. Google Cloud's infrastructure and platform services were the largest drivers of growth in Google Cloud Platform.

Use of Non-GAAP Constant Currency Information International revenues, which represent a significant portion of our revenues, are generally transacted in multiple currencies and therefore are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons. We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) results helps improve the ability to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue",

For the three months ended March 31, 2023, unallocated corporate costs include charges related to the reductions in our workforce and office space totaling $2.5 billion. Google Services Google Services operating income decreased $236 million from the three months ended March 31, 2022 to the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by an increase in compensation expenses, partially offset by the effect of the shift in timing of our annual employee stock-based compensation awards, a reduction in costs driven by the change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment, and growth in revenues. Google Cloud Google Cloud operating income of $191 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to an operating loss of $706 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 represents an increase of $897 million. The increase was primarily driven by revenue growth, partially offset by an increase in compensation expenses. Additionally, operating income benefited from a reduction in costs driven by the change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment and the effect of the shift in timing of our annual employee stock- based compensation awards. Other Bets Other Bets operating loss increased $390 million from the three months ended March 31, 2022 to the three months ended March 31, 2023 due to a combination of factors none of which were individually significant.

Revenue Backlog As of March 31, 2024, we had $72.5 billion of remaining performance obligations (\u201crevenue backlog\u201d), primarily related to Google Cloud. Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenue. The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts. Deferred Revenues We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2023 was $5.0 billion, of which $2.4 billion was recognized as revenues during the three months ended March 31, 2024. Note 3.

The results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements. For certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us, and their creditors do not have recourse to us. As of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $4.9 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs were $2.5 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs that are included within Other Bets. Total noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were $3.4 billion and $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively, of which $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion is redeemable noncontrolling interest (RNCI) as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was not material for any period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of OI&E. See Note 6 for further details on OI&E. Unconsolidated VIEs We have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private companies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve power generation using renewable sources. We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We account for these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments. The maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the investments and any future funding commitments. The maximum exposure and carrying value of these unconsolidated VIEs were $5.7 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2023 and $6.9 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively, as of March 31, 2024.

Understanding Alphabet\u2019s Financial Results Alphabet is a collection of businesses \u2014 the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, Google Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For further details on our segments, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Revenues and Monetization Metrics We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and devices. For additional information on how we recognize revenue, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. In addition to the long-term trends and their financial effect on our business discussed in \"Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect\" in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, fluctuations in our revenues have been and may continue to be affected by a combination of factors, including: \u2022 changes in foreign currency exchange rates; \u2022 changes in pricing, such as those resulting from changes in fee structures, discounts, and customer incentives; \u2022 general economic conditions and various external dynamics, including geopolitical events, regulations, and other measures and their effect on advertiser, consumer, and enterprise spending; \u2022 new product and service launches; and \u2022 seasonality. Additionally, fluctuations in our revenues generated from advertising (\"Google advertising\"), revenues from other sources (\"Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues\"), Google Cloud, and Other Bets revenues have been, and may continue to be, affected by other factors unique to each set of revenues, as described below. Google Services Google Services revenues consist of Google advertising as well as Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues. Google Advertising Google advertising revenues are comprised of the following: \u2022 Google Search & other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play; \u2022 YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and \u2022 Google Network, which includes revenues generated on",

Revenue Backlog As of March 31, 2025, we had $92.4 billion of remaining performance obligations (\u201crevenue backlog\u201d), primarily related to Google Cloud. Revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately 55% of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months with the remainder to be recognized thereafter. The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts. Deferred Revenues We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2024 was $6.0 billion, of which $2.6 billion was recognized as revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2025. Total deferred revenue as of March 31, 2025 was $6.6 billion. Note 3.

Other Information: \u2022 In March 2025, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Wiz, a leading cloud security platform, for $32.0 billion, subject to closing adjustments, in an all-cash transaction. The acquisition of Wiz is expected to close in 2026, subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals.

Use of Non-GAAP Constant Currency Information International revenues, which represent a significant portion of our revenues, are generally transacted in multiple currencies and therefore are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons. We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period. Constant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period revenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP. 38",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Google was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google. We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide customers with infrastructure and platform services and collaboration tools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV. Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Unaudited Interim Financial Information These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2022. We have made estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. These consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 filed with the SEC. Stock Split Effected in the Form of a Stock Dividend (\u201cStock Split\u201d) On February 1, 2022, the company announced that the Board of Directors had approved and declared a 20- for-one stock split in the form of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the company\u2019s Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. The Stock Split had a record date of July 1, 2022 and an effective date of July 15, 2022. The par value per share of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock remains unchanged at $0.001 per share after the Stock Split. All references made to share or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and applicable disclosures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split.

We report Google in two segments, Google Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Other Bets include earlier stage technologies that are further afield from our core Google business. For further details on our segments, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Seasonality and other Our advertising revenues are affected by seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends, such as traditional retail seasonality. Additionally, our non-advertising revenues, including those generated from Google Cloud, Google Play, hardware, and YouTube, may be affected by fluctuations driven by changes in pricing, digital content releases, fee structures, new product and service launches, and other market dynamics, as well as seasonality. Revenues and Monetization Metrics Google Services Google Services revenues consist of revenues generated from advertising (\u201cGoogle advertising\u201d) as well as revenues from other sources (\u201cGoogle other revenues\u201d). Google Advertising Google advertising revenues are comprised of the following: \u2022 Google Search & other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play; \u2022 YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and \u2022 Google Network, which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. We use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our advertising revenues: paid clicks and cost-per-click pertain to traffic on Google Search & other properties, while impressions and cost-per-impressions pertain to traffic on our Network partners\u2019 properties. Paid clicks represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users on Google search properties and other Google owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play. Cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users. Impressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based revenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression displayed to users.

This reflects, when rounding to the one decimal place, the percentage change in consolidated revenues and consolidated constant currency revenues year over year of 12.6% and 16.3%, respectively. \u2022 Revenues were $69.7 billion, an increase of 13% year over year, primarily driven by an increase in Google Services segment revenues of $5.8 billion or 10% and an increase in Google Cloud segment revenues of $1.6 billion or 36%. \u2022 Cost of revenues was $30.1 billion, an increase of 15% year over year, driven by increases in other costs of revenues and TAC. \u2022 Operating expenses were $20.1 billion, an increase of 24% year over year, primarily driven by increases in compensation due to headcount growth, professional services fees and advertising and promotional expenses. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in charges related to legal matters. Other information \u2022 On July 15, 2022, the company executed a 20-for-one stock split with a record date of July 1, 2022, effected in the form of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the company's Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. All references made to share or per share amounts throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. \u2022 Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, we suspended the vast majority of our commercial activities in Russia and effectively ceased business activities of our Russian entity. The ongoing effect of these direct actions on our financial results was not material. The broader economic effects resulting from the war in Ukraine on our future financial results may be unpredictable. \u2022 Repurchases of Class A and Class C shares were $15.2 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2022. In April 2022, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares. See Note 10 of the Notes to",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Google was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google. We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products. Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Unaudited Interim Financial Information These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2023. We have made estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. These consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the SEC. Change in Accounting Estimate In January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and adjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain network equipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December 31, 2022, and those placed in service during the six months ended June 30, 2023, the effect of this change in estimate was a reduction in depreciation expense of $966 million and $2.0 billion and an increase in net income of $752 million and $1.5 billion, or $0.06 and $0.12 per basic and $0.06 and $0.12 per diluted share, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively.

The amount and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services, which could affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when we expect to recognize such as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts. Deferred Revenues We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2022 was $4.5 billion, of which $2.1 billion was recognized as revenues during the six months ended June 30, 2023. 12",

Note 4. Variable Interest Entities (VIE) Consolidated VIEs We consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements. For certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us and their creditors do not have recourse to us. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $4.1 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs were $2.6 billion for both periods. We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs that are included within Other Bets. Total noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were $3.8 billion and $3.6 billion as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023, respectively, of which $1.1 billion is redeemable noncontrolling interest (RNCI) for both periods. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was not material for any period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of OI&E. See Note 6 for further details on OI&E. Unconsolidated VIEs We have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private companies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve power generation using renewable sources. We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We account for these investments as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments. The maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the investments and any future funding commitments. We have determined that the single source of our exposure to these VIEs is our capital investments in them. The carrying value and maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs were $2.7 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2022 and $3.0 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2023.

We report Google in two segments, Google Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For further details on our segments, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Revenues and Monetization Metrics We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products. For details on how we recognize revenue, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. In addition to the long-term trends and their financial effect on our business noted in \"Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect\" in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, fluctuations in our revenues have been and may continue to be affected by a combination of factors, including: \u2022 changes in foreign currency exchange rates; \u2022 changes in pricing, such as those resulting from changes in fee structures, discounts, and customer incentives; \u2022 general economic conditions and various external dynamics, including geopolitical events, regulations, and other measures and their effect on advertiser, consumer, and enterprise spending; \u2022 new product and service launches; and \u2022 seasonality. Additionally, fluctuations in our revenues generated from advertising (\"Google advertising\"), revenues from other sources (\"Google other revenues\"), Google Cloud, and Other Bets revenues have been and may continue to be affected by other factors unique to each set of revenues, as described below. Google Services Google Services revenues consist of Google advertising as well as Google other revenues. Google Advertising Google advertising revenues are comprised of the following: \u2022 Google Search & other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play; \u2022 YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and \u2022 Google Network, which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad",

An overall increase in data center and other operations costs was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in estimated useful lives of our servers and certain network equipment. \u2022 Operating expenses were $20.9 billion, an increase of 4% year over year, primarily driven by an increase in compensation expenses largely due to headcount growth, partially offset by a reduction in valuation-based compensation liabilities related to certain Other Bets. Additionally, operating expenses benefited from a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in the estimated useful lives of our servers and certain network equipment.

Use of Non-GAAP Constant Currency Information International revenues, which represent a significant portion of our revenues, are generally transacted in multiple currencies and therefore are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons. We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period. Constant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period revenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP. 40",

Revenue Backlog As of June 30, 2024, we had $78.8 billion of remaining performance obligations (\u201crevenue backlog\u201d), primarily related to Google Cloud. Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenue. The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts. Deferred Revenues We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2023 was $5.0 billion, of which $2.9 billion was recognized as revenues during the six months ended June 30, 2024. Note 3.

Note 4. Variable Interest Entities (VIE) Consolidated VIEs We consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements. For certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us, and their creditors do not have recourse to us. As of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2024, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $4.9 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs were $2.5 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs that are included within Other Bets. In July 2024, Alphabet committed to fund up to $5.0 billion for the ongoing operations of Waymo, a fully autonomous driving technology company and a consolidated VIE. Total noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were $3.4 billion and $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2024, respectively, of which $1.1 billion is redeemable noncontrolling interest (RNCI) for both periods. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was not material for any period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of OI&E. See Note 6 for further details on OI&E. Unconsolidated VIEs We have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private companies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve power generation using renewable sources. We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We account for these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments. The maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the investments and any future funding commitments. The maximum exposure and carrying value of these unconsolidated VIEs were $5.7 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2023 and $6.9 billion and $5.4 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2024.

Understanding Alphabet\u2019s Financial Results Alphabet is a collection of businesses \u2014 the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, Google Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For further details on our segments, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Revenues and Monetization Metrics We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and devices. For additional information on how we recognize revenue, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. In addition to the long-term trends and their financial effect on our business discussed in \"Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect\" in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, fluctuations in our revenues have been and may continue to be affected by a combination of factors, including: \u2022 changes in foreign currency exchange rates; \u2022 changes in pricing, such as those resulting from changes in fee structures, discounts, and customer incentives; \u2022 general economic conditions and various external dynamics, including geopolitical events, regulations, and other measures and their effect on advertiser, consumer, and enterprise spending; \u2022 new product and service launches; and \u2022 seasonality. Additionally, fluctuations in our revenues generated from advertising (\"Google advertising\"), revenues from other sources (\"Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues\"), Google Cloud, and Other Bets revenues have been, and may continue to be, affected by other factors unique to each set of revenues, as described below.

Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based revenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression displayed to users. As our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues generated by the corresponding click and impression activity. Fluctuations in our advertising revenues, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search & other properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties and the correlation between these items have been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition to the general factors described above, such as: \u2022 advertiser competition for keywords; \u2022 changes in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy; \u2022 changes in device mix; \u2022 seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends, such as traditional retail seasonality; and \u2022 traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various verticals and channels. Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues are comprised of the following: \u2022 consumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One; \u2022 platforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play from the sales of apps and in-app purchases; \u2022 devices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices; and \u2022 other products and services.

Changes in cost-per-click and cost-per-impression are driven by a number of interrelated factors including changes in device mix, geographic mix, advertiser spending, ongoing product and policy changes, product mix, property mix, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues increased $1.2 billion and $2.5 billion from the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively. The growth was primarily driven by an increase in subscription revenues, largely from growth in the number of paid subscribers for YouTube services. Google Cloud Google Cloud revenues increased $2.3 billion and $4.4 billion from the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively. The growth was primarily driven by Google Cloud Platform followed by Google Workspace offerings.

Use of Non-GAAP Constant Currency Information International revenues, which represent a significant portion of our revenues, are generally transacted in multiple currencies and therefore are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons. We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period. Constant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period revenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.

Revenue Backlog As of June 30, 2025, we had $108.2 billion of remaining performance obligations (\u201crevenue backlog\u201d), primarily related to Google Cloud. Revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately 55% of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months with the remainder to be recognized thereafter. The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts. Deferred Revenues We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2024 was $6.0 billion, of which $3.5 billion was recognized as revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2025. Total deferred revenue as of June 30, 2025 was $6.8 billion. Note 3.

We report Google in two segments, Google Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For further details on our segments, see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Revenues and Monetization Metrics We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure, platform services, and applications; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and devices. For additional information on how we recognize revenue, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. In addition to the long-term trends and their financial effect on our business discussed in \"Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect\" in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, fluctuations in our revenues have been and may continue to be affected by a combination of factors, including: \u2022 changes in foreign currency exchange rates; \u2022 changes in pricing, such as those resulting from changes in fee structures, discounts, and customer incentives; \u2022 general economic conditions and various external dynamics, including geopolitical events, regulations, and other measures and their effect on advertiser, consumer, and enterprise spending; \u2022 new product, service, and market launches; and \u2022 seasonality. Additionally, fluctuations in our revenues generated from advertising (\"Google advertising\"), other sources (\"Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices\"), Google Cloud, and Other Bets have been, and may continue to be, affected by other factors unique to each set of revenues, as described below. Google Services Google Services revenues consist of Google advertising as well as Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues.

We are monitoring ongoing developments surrounding international trade and the macroeconomic environment. As a result of volatility in international trade and financial markets, we may experience direct and indirect effects on our business, operations, and financial results. Our past results may not be indicative of our future performance, and our financial results may differ materially from historical trends. On July 4, 2025 the OBBBA was signed into law. We are assessing the legislation and its effects on our business, operations, and financial results, including the potential effects on our effective tax rate.

The growth was driven by our direct response advertising products followed by our brand advertising products, both of which benefited from increased spending by our advertisers. Google Network Google Network revenues decreased $90 million from the three months ended June 30, 2024 to the three months ended June 30, 2025, primarily due to a decrease in AdSense and Google Ad Manager revenues, partially offset by an increase in AdMob revenues. Google Network revenues decreased $247 million from the six months ended June 30, 2024 to the six months ended June 30, 2025, primarily due to a decrease in Google Ad Manager revenues and the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in AdSense revenues. Monetization Metrics The following table presents changes in monetization metrics for Google Search & other revenues (paid clicks and cost-per-click) and Google Network revenues (impressions and cost-per-impression), expressed as a percentage, from three and six months ended June 30, 2024 to three and six months ended June 30, 2025: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, 2025 June 30, 2025 Google Search & other Paid clicks change 4 % 3 % Cost-per-click change 8 % 8 % Google Network Impressions change (6)% (5) % Cost-per-impression change 6 % 5 % Changes in paid clicks and impressions are driven by a number of interrelated factors, including changes in advertiser spending; ongoing product and policy changes; and, as it relates to paid clicks, fluctuations in search queries resulting from changes in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices. Changes in cost-per-click and cost-per-impression are driven by a number of interrelated factors including changes in device mix, geographic mix, advertiser spending, ongoing product and policy changes, product mix, property mix, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues increased $1.9 billion and $3.5 billion from the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2025. The growth was primarily driven by an increase in subscription revenues. This increase was primarily due to the contribution from growth in paid subscriptions across both YouTube services and Google One. Google Cloud Google Cloud revenues increased $3.3 billion and $6.0 billion from the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 primarily driven by growth in Google Cloud Platform largely from infrastructure services. 42",

Use of Non-GAAP Constant Currency Information International revenues, which represent a significant portion of our revenues, are generally transacted in multiple currencies and therefore are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons. We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period. Constant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period revenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP. 43",

Revenue Backlog and Deferred Revenues As of September 30, 2022, we had $52.4 billion of remaining performance obligations (\u201crevenue backlog\u201d), primarily related to Google Cloud, and expect to recognize approximately half of this amount as revenues over the next 24 months with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenues. The amount and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by when our customers utilize services and our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms, which could affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when we expect to recognize such as revenues. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts. We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2021 was $3.8 billion, of which $2.4 billion was recognized as revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Note 3.

We report Google in two segments, Google Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Other Bets include earlier stage technologies that are further afield from our core Google business. For further details on our segments, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Seasonality and other Our advertising revenues are affected by seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends, such as traditional retail seasonality. Additionally, our non-advertising revenues, including those generated from Google Cloud, Google Play, hardware, and YouTube, may be affected by fluctuations driven by changes in pricing, digital content releases, fee structures, new product and service launches, and other market dynamics, as well as seasonality. Revenues and Monetization Metrics Google Services Google Services revenues consist of revenues generated from advertising (\u201cGoogle advertising\u201d) as well as revenues from other sources (\u201cGoogle other revenues\u201d). Google Advertising Google advertising revenues are comprised of the following: \u2022 Google Search & other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play; \u2022 YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and \u2022 Google Network, which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. We use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our advertising revenues: paid clicks and cost-per-click pertain to traffic on Google Search & other properties, while impressions and cost-per-impressions pertain to traffic on our Network partners\u2019 properties. Paid clicks represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users on Google search properties and other Google owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play. Cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users. Impressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based revenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression displayed to users.

The cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly higher than the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search & other properties, because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners. Operating Expenses Operating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as either R&D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative. The main components of our R&D expenses are: \u2022 compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&D related to our existing and new products and services; \u2022 depreciation; and \u2022 professional services fees primarily related to consulting and outsourcing services. The main components of our sales and marketing expenses are: \u2022 compensation expenses for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain customer service functions; and \u2022 spending relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services.

The overall growth was driven by interrelated factors including increases in search queries resulting from growth in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices, growth in advertiser spending, and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery. Growth was partially offset by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates.

Revenues by Geography The following table presents revenues by geography as a percentage of revenues, determined based on the addresses of our customers: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2021 2022 2021 2022 United States 46 % 48 % 46 % 47 % EMEA 30 % 28 % 31 % 29 % APAC 18 % 17 % 18 % 17 % Other Americas 6 % 6 % 5 % 6 % Hedging gains (losses) 0 % 1 % 0 % 1 % For further details on revenues by geography, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Use of Constant Currency Revenues and Constant Currency Revenue Percentage Change The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons. We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to understand our performance because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. We define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, and use it to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period. Constant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period revenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP. 40",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Google was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google. We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products. Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Unaudited Interim Financial Information These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2023. We have made estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. These consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the SEC. Change in Accounting Estimate In January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and adjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain network equipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December 31, 2022, and those placed in service during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the effect of this change in estimate was a reduction in depreciation expense of $977 million and $2.9 billion and an increase in net income of $761 million and $2.3 billion, or $0.06 and $0.18 per basic and $0.06 and $0.18 per diluted share, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Prior Period Reclassifications Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation. 11",

Revenue Backlog As of September 30, 2023, we had $64.9 billion of remaining performance obligations (\u201crevenue backlog\u201d), primarily related to Google Cloud. Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenue. The amount and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services, which could affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when we expect to recognize such as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts. Deferred Revenues We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2022 was $4.5 billion, of which $2.3 billion was recognized as revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 12",

Note 4. Variable Interest Entities (VIE) Consolidated VIEs We consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements. For certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us and their creditors do not have recourse to us. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $4.1 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs were $2.6 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs that are included within Other Bets. Total noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were $3.8 billion and $3.4 billion as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023, respectively, of which $1.1 billion is redeemable noncontrolling interest (RNCI) for both periods.

Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was not material for any period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of OI&E. See Note 6 for further details on OI&E. Unconsolidated VIEs We have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private companies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve power generation using renewable sources. We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We account for these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments. The maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the investments and any future funding commitments. The maximum exposure and carrying value of these unconsolidated VIEs were $2.8 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2022 and $5.5 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, as of September 30, 2023.

As a result, total employee severance and related charges recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were $86 million and $2.1 billion, respectively. Substantially all of the employees affected were no longer included in our headcount as of September 30, 2023. In addition, we are taking actions to optimize our global office space. As a result, exit charges recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, were $16 million and $649 million, respectively, as reflected in the table below. In addition to these exit charges, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred $207 million in accelerated rent and accelerated depreciation, which are not included in the table below. We may incur additional charges in the future as we further evaluate our real estate needs. 24",

We report Google in two segments, Google Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For further details on our segments, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Revenues and Monetization Metrics We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products. For details on how we recognize revenue, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. In addition to the long-term trends and their financial effect on our business noted in \"Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect\" in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, fluctuations in our revenues have been and may continue to be affected by a combination of factors, including: \u2022 changes in foreign currency exchange rates; \u2022 changes in pricing, such as those resulting from changes in fee structures, discounts, and customer incentives; \u2022 general economic conditions and various external dynamics, including geopolitical events, regulations, and other measures and their effect on advertiser, consumer, and enterprise spending; \u2022 new product and service launches; and \u2022 seasonality.

The effect of this change was a reduction in depreciation expense of $977 million and $2.9 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, recognized primarily in cost of revenues and R&D expenses. For additional information, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. \u2022 On July 21, 2023, the IRS announced a rule change allowing taxpayers to temporarily apply the regulations in effect prior to 2022 related to U.S. federal foreign tax credits. This announcement only applies to foreign taxes paid or accrued in the fiscal years 2022 and 2023. A cumulative one-time adjustment applicable to prior periods for this tax rule change was recorded in the third quarter of 2023 and resulted in our effective tax rate of 7.1% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 and 13.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. \u2022 Repurchases of Class A and Class C shares were $15.9 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Use of Non-GAAP Constant Currency Information International revenues, which represent a significant portion of our revenues, are generally transacted in multiple currencies and therefore are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons. We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period. Constant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period revenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP. 41",

Revenue Backlog As of September 30, 2024, we had $86.8 billion of remaining performance obligations (\u201crevenue backlog\u201d), primarily related to Google Cloud. Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenue. The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months with the remainder to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts. Deferred Revenues We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2023 was $5.0 billion, of which $3.4 billion was recognized as revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Note 3.

Understanding Alphabet\u2019s Financial Results Alphabet is a collection of businesses \u2014 the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, Google Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For further details on our segments, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Revenues and Monetization Metrics We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and devices. For additional information on how we recognize revenue, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. In addition to the long-term trends and their financial effect on our business discussed in \"Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect\" in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, fluctuations in our revenues have been and may continue to be affected by a combination of factors, including: \u2022 changes in foreign currency exchange rates; \u2022 changes in pricing, such as those resulting from changes in fee structures, discounts, and customer incentives; \u2022 general economic conditions and various external dynamics, including geopolitical events, regulations, and other measures and their effect on advertiser, consumer, and enterprise spending; \u2022 new product and service launches; and \u2022 seasonality. Additionally, fluctuations in our revenues generated from advertising (\"Google advertising\"), revenues from other sources (\"Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues\"), Google Cloud, and Other Bets revenues have been, and may continue to be, affected by other factors unique to each set of revenues, as described below.

Cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users. Impressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based revenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression displayed to users. As our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues generated by the corresponding click and impression activity. Fluctuations in our advertising revenues, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search & other properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties and the correlation between these items have been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition to the general factors described above, such as: \u2022 advertiser competition for keywords; \u2022 changes in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy; \u2022 changes in device mix; \u2022 seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends, such as traditional retail seasonality; and \u2022 traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various verticals and channels. Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues are comprised of the following: \u2022 consumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One; \u2022 platforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play from the sales of apps and in-app purchases; \u2022 devices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices; and \u2022 other products and services.

The growth was primarily driven by increases in subscriptions and devices revenues. The increase in subscriptions revenues was largely from growth in the number of paid subscribers for YouTube services and to a lesser extent for Google One. The increase in devices revenues was primarily driven by increased sales of Pixel devices, due to Pixel family product launch timing in the third quarter this year as compared to the fourth quarter last year. Google Cloud Google Cloud revenues increased $2.9 billion and $7.4 billion from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.

        "text": "Revenues by Geography The following table presents revenues by geography as a percentage of revenues, determined based on the addresses of our customers: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2023 2024 2023 2024 United States 47 % 49 % 47 % 49 % EMEA 30 % 29 % 30 % 29 % APAC 17 % 16 % 17 % 16 % Other Americas 6 % 6 % 6 % 6 % Hedging gains (losses) 0 % 0 % 0 % 0 % For additional information, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Use of Non-GAAP Constant Currency Information International revenues, which represent a significant portion of our revenues, are generally transacted in multiple currencies and therefore are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons. We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period. Constant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period revenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP. 39",
