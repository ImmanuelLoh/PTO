Working with content creators and partners, we continue to build new ways for people around the\nworld to find great digital content.\nFueling all of these great digital experiences are extraordinary platforms and hardware. That is why we continue\nto invest in platforms like our Android mobile operating system, Chrome browser, and Chrome operating system, as\nwell as growing our family of hardware devices. We see tremendous potential for devices to be helpful and make\npeople's lives easier by combining the best of our AI, software, and hardware. This potential is reflected in our latest\ngeneration of hardware products such as the new Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro, and the very first Pixel Watch. Creating\nproducts that people rely on every day is a journey that we are investing in for the long-term.\nHow we make money\nWe have built world-class advertising technologies for advertisers, agencies, and publishers to power their digital\nmarketing businesses. Our advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses through our wide\nrange of products across devices and formats, and we aim to ensure positive user experiences by serving the right ads\nat the right time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies.\nGoogle Services generates revenues primarily by delivering both performance and brand advertising that appears\non Google Search & other properties, YouTube, and Google Network partners' properties (\"Google Network\nproperties\"). We continue to invest in both performance and brand advertising and seek to improve the measurability of\nadvertising so advertisers understand the effectiveness of their campaigns.\n\u2022 Performance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click on leading to direct\nengagement with advertisers. Performance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while driving\nmeasurable results. Our ads tools allow performance advertisers to create simple text-based ads.\n\u2022 Brand advertising helps enhance users' awareness of and affinity for advertisers' products and services,\nthrough videos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across various devices. We help brand\nadvertisers deliver digital videos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their brand-building marketing\ncampaigns.\nWe have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web.\nWe focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways, including filtering\nout invalid traffic, removing billions of bad ads from our systems every year, and closely monitoring the sites, apps, and\nvideos where ads appear and blocklisting them when necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content.\nWe continue to focus on growing revenues beyond advertising, from Google Play, hardware, and YouTube\nsubscriptions, such as:\n\u2022 Google Play generates revenues from sales of apps and in-app purchases.\n\u2022 Hardware generates revenues from sales of Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, and Pixel\ndevices.\n\u2022 YouTube non-advertising generates subscription revenues from services such as YouTube Premium and\nYouTube TV.\nGoogle Cloud\nGoogle was a company built in the cloud, and we continue to invest in our Google Cloud offerings, including\nGoogle Cloud Platform and Google Workspace. Google Cloud Platform provides leading technology in cybersecurity;\ndata, analytics, AI, and machine learning; and infrastructure. Our cybersecurity products help customers detect,\nprotect, and respond to a broad range of cybersecurity threats. Our data cloud unifies data lakes, data warehouses,\ndata governance, and advanced machine learning into a single platform that can analyze data across any cloud. We\nprovide customers an open, reliable, and scalable infrastructure that enables them to run workloads anywhere \u2014 on\nour Cloud, at the edge, or in their data centers. Additionally, Google Workspace's easy-to-use and secure\ncommunication and collaboration tools, which include apps like Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar, Meet, and more, enable\nsecure hybrid work, boosting productivity and collaboration.\nOther Bets\nAcross Alphabet we are also using technology to try to solve big problems that affect a wide variety of industries\nfrom improving transportation and health technology to exploring solutions to address climate change. Alphabet\u2019s\ninvestment in the portfolio of Other Bets includes businesses that are at various stages of development, ranging from\nthose in the R&D phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization. Our goal is for them to become\nthriving, successful businesses. Other Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own\n6",

While these early-stage businesses naturally come with\nconsiderable uncertainty, some of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their\nindustries. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\nCompetition\nOur business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptive technologies. We face formidable\ncompetition in every aspect of our business, including, among others, from:\n\u2022 general purpose search engines and information services;\n\u2022 vertical search engines and e-commerce providers for queries related to travel, jobs, and health, which users\nmay navigate directly to rather than go through Google;\n\u2022 online advertising platforms and networks;\n\u2022 other forms of advertising, such as billboards, magazines, newspapers, radio, and television as our advertisers\ntypically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline;\n\u2022 digital content and application platform providers;\n\u2022 providers of enterprise cloud services;\n\u2022 companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that\nhave developed proprietary platforms;\n\u2022 providers of digital video services;\n\u2022 social networks, which users may rely on for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information\nthrough traditional search engines;\n\u2022 providers of workspace communication and connectivity products; and\n\u2022 digital assistant providers.\nCompeting successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and\ntechnologies to the marketplace across our businesses. For example, for advertising, competing successfully depends\non attracting and retaining:\n\u2022 users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance\nof our advertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and availability of our products and services;\n\u2022 advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver\ntheir advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels; and\n\u2022 content providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners\ngenerate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\nFor additional information about competition, see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOngoing Commitment to Sustainability\nWe believe that every business has the opportunity and obligation to protect our planet. Sustainability is one of\nour core values at Google, and we strive to build sustainability into everything we do. We have been a leader on\nsustainability and climate change since Google\u2019s founding more than 20 years ago. These are some of our key\nachievements over the past two decades:\n\u2022 In 2007, we became the first major company to be carbon neutral for our operations.\n\u2022 In 2017, we became the first major company to match 100% of our annual electricity use with renewable\nenergy, which we have achieved for five consecutive years.\n\u2022 In 2020, we issued $5.75 billion in sustainability bonds\u2014the largest sustainability or green bond issuance by\nany company in history at the time. The net proceeds from the issuance were used to fund environmentally\nand socially responsible projects in the following eight areas: energy efficiency, clean energy, green buildings,\nclean transportation, circular economy and design, affordable housing, commitment to racial equity, and\nsupport for small businesses and COVID-19 crisis response. As of 2022, we had fully allocated the net\nproceeds from our sustainability bonds as outlined in our Sustainability Bond Impact Report published in 2022.\nOur sustainability strategy is focused on three key pillars: accelerating the transition to carbon-free energy and a\ncircular economy, empowering everyone with technology, and benefiting the people and places where we operate.\n7",

By 2030, we aim to:\n\u2022 achieve net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain, including our consumer hardware\nproducts;\n\u2022 become the first major company to run on carbon-free energy 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a\nyear;\n\u2022 enable 5 gigawatts of new carbon-free energy through investments in our key manufacturing regions; and\n\u2022 help more than 500 cities and local governments reduce an aggregate of 1 gigaton (one billion tons) of carbon\nemissions annually.\nWe also aim to maximize the reuse of finite resources across our operations, products, and supply chains and to\nenable others to do the same.\nWe are committed to helping people make more sustainable choices by empowering them with technology. We\nintroduced eco-friendly routing in Google Maps; new features to book flights or purchase appliances that have lower\ncarbon footprints; and when people come to Google Search with questions about climate change, we show information\nfrom authoritative sources like the United Nations.\nTo benefit the people and places where we operate, we have set goals to replenish more water than we consume\nby 2030 and to support water security in communities where we operate. We are focused on three areas: enhancing\nour stewardship of water resources across Google offices and data centers; replenishing our water use and improving\nwatershed health and ecosystems in water-stressed communities; and sharing technology and tools that help\neveryone predict, prevent, and recover from water stress. At Google we remain steadfast in our commitment to\nsustainability, and we will continue to lead and encourage others to join us in improving the health of our planet. We\nare proud of what we have achieved so far, and we are energized to help move the world closer to a more sustainable\nand carbon-free future for all.\nMore information on our approach to sustainability can be found in our annual sustainability reports, including\nGoogle\u2019s Environmental Report.

We embrace collaboration and creativity, and\nencourage the iteration of ideas to address complex challenges in technology and society.\nOur people are critical for our continued success, so we work hard to create an environment where employees\ncan have fulfilling careers, and be happy, healthy, and productive. We offer industry-leading benefits and programs to\ntake care of the diverse needs of our employees and their families, including opportunities for career growth and\ndevelopment, resources to support their financial health, and access to excellent healthcare choices. Our competitive\ncompensation programs help us to attract and retain top candidates, and we will continue to invest in recruiting\ntalented people to technical and non-technical roles, and rewarding them well. We provide a variety of high quality\ntraining and support to managers to build and strengthen their capabilities-\u2013ranging from courses for new managers, to\nlearning resources that help them provide feedback and manage performance, to coaching and individual support.\nAt Alphabet we are committed to making diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do and to growing a\nworkforce that is representative of the users we serve. More information on Google\u2019s approach to diversity can be\nfound in our annual diversity reports, available publicly at diversity.google. The contents of our diversity reports are not\nincorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the\nSEC.\nAs of December 31, 2022, Alphabet had 190,234 employees. We have work councils and statutory employee\nrepresentation obligations in certain countries, and we are committed to supporting protected labor rights, maintaining\nan open culture, and listening to all employees. Supporting healthy and open dialogue is central to how we work, and\nwe communicate information about the company through multiple internal channels to our employees.\nWhen necessary we contract with businesses around the world to provide specialized services where we do not\nhave appropriate in-house expertise or resources, often in fields that require specialized training like cafe operations,\ncontent moderation, customer support, and physical security. We also contract with temporary staffing agencies when\nwe need to cover short-term leaves, when we have spikes in business needs, or when we need to quickly incubate\n8",

We expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these\nmarkets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available. This trend could affect our revenues as\ndeveloping markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets.\nInternational revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a foreign exchange risk management program\ndesigned to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues\nand earnings.\n\u2022 The revenues that we derive from non-advertising products and services are increasing and may\nadversely affect our margins.\nNon-advertising revenues have grown over time, and we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding\nour products and services. The margins on these revenues vary significantly and are generally lower than the margins\non our advertising revenues. In particular margins on our hardware products adversely affect our consolidated margins\ndue to pressures on pricing and higher cost of sales.\n\u2022 As we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and\ncapital expenditures.\nWe continue to make significant research and development investments in areas of strategic focus as we seek to\ndevelop new, innovative offerings and improve our existing offerings across our businesses. We also expect to\ncontinue to invest in our technical infrastructure, including servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support\nthe growth of our business and our long-term initiatives, in particular in support of AI. In addition acquisitions and\nstrategic investments contribute to the breadth and depth of our offerings, expand our expertise in engineering and\nother functional areas, and build strong partnerships around strategic initiatives. For example, in September 2022 we\nclosed the acquisition of Mandiant to help expand our offerings in dynamic cyber defense and response.\n\u2022 We face continuing changes in regulatory conditions, laws, and public policies, which could affect our\nbusiness practices and financial results.\nChanges in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide\nrange of topics and related legal matters have resulted in fines and caused us to change our business practices. As\nthese global trends continue, our cost of doing business may increase, our ability to pursue certain business models or\noffer certain products or services may be limited, and we may need to change our business practices. Examples\ninclude the antitrust complaints filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and a number of state Attorneys General;\npending litigation in the U.S., EU, and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for\nwebsites and online platforms; and the Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act in Europe and various legislative\nproposals in the U.S. focused on large technology platforms.

We expect to continue\nhiring talented employees around the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs. For additional\ninformation see Culture and Workforce in Part I, Item 1 \u201cBusiness.\u201d\nRevenues and Monetization Metrics\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide\nenterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration\ntools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for\nsubscription-based products. For details on how we recognize revenue, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition to the long-term trends and their financial effect on our business noted above, fluctuations in our\nrevenues have been and may continue to be affected by a combination of factors, including:\n\u2022 changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022 changes in pricing, such as those resulting from changes in fee structures, discounts, and customer incentives;\n\u2022 general economic conditions and various external dynamics, including geopolitical events, regulations, and\nother measures and their effect on advertiser, consumer, and enterprise spending;\n\u2022 new product and service launches; and\n27",

This led to the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, or BERT, in 2019 that helped\nSearch understand the intent of user search queries better than ever before.\nGoogle was a company built in the cloud, and we continue to invest in our Google Cloud offerings, including\nGoogle Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, to help organizations stay at the forefront of AI innovation with our AI-\noptimized infrastructure, mature AI platform and world-class models, and assistive agents.\nWe believe AI can solve some of the hardest societal, scientific and engineering challenges of our time. For\nexample, in 2020, Google DeepMind\u2019s AlphaFold system solved a 50-year-old protein folding challenge. Since then,\nwe have open-sourced to the scientific community 200 million of AlphaFold\u2019s protein structures which are used to work\non everything from accelerating new malaria vaccines to advancing cancer drug discovery and developing plastic-\neating enzymes. As another example, AI can also have a transformative effect on climate progress by providing helpful\ninformation, predicting climate-related events, and optimizing climate action. Using advanced AI and geospatial\nanalysis, Google Research has developed flood forecasting models that can provide early warning and real-time\nflooding information to communities and individuals.\nAs AI continues to improve rapidly, we are focused on giving helpful features to our users and customers as we\ndeliver on our mission to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful. With a bold\nand responsible approach, we continue to take the next steps to make this technology even more helpful for everyone.\nDeliver the Most Advanced, Safe, and Responsible AI\nWe aim to build the most advanced, safe, and responsible AI with models that are developed, trained, and\nrigorously tested at scale powered by our continued investment in AI technical infrastructure. In December 2023, we\nlaunched Gemini, our most capable and general model. It was built from the ground up to be multimodal, which means\nit can generalize and seamlessly understand, operate across, and combine different types of information, including\ntext, code, audio, images, and video. Our teams across Alphabet will leverage Gemini, as well as other AI models we\nhave previously developed and announced, across our business to deliver the best product and service experiences\nfor our users, advertisers, partners, customers, and developers.\nWe believe our approach to AI must be both bold and responsible. That means developing AI in a way that\nmaximizes the positive benefits to society while addressing the challenges, guided by our AI Principles. We published\nthese in 2018, as one of the first companies to articulate principles that put beneficial use, users, safety, and avoidance\nof harms above business considerations. While there is natural tension between being bold and being responsible, we\nbelieve it is possible \u2014 and in fact critical \u2014 to embrace that tension productively.\nEnable Organizations and Developers to Innovate on Google Cloud\nAI is not only a powerful enabler, it is also a major platform shift. Globally, businesses from startups to large\nenterprises, and the public sector are thinking about how to drive transformation. That is why we are focused on\nmaking it easy and scalable for others to innovate, and grow, with AI. That means providing the most advanced\ncomputing infrastructure and expanding access to Google\u2019s latest AI models that have been rigorously tested in our\nown products. Our Vertex AI platform gives developers the ability to train, tune, augment, and deploy applications using\ngenerative AI models and services such as Enterprise Search and Conversations. Duet AI for Google Cloud provides\npre-packaged AI agents that assist developers to write, test, document, and operate software.\nImprove Knowledge, Learning, Creativity, and Productivity\nThings that we now consider routine \u2013 like spell check, mobile check deposit, or Google Search, Google\nTranslate, and Google Maps \u2013 all use AI. As AI continues to improve rapidly, we are focused on giving helpful features\nto our users as we continue to deliver on our mission to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally\naccessible and useful.\nWhile we have been integrating AI into our products for years, we are now embedding the power of generative AI\nto continue helping our users express themselves and get things done. For example, Duet AI in Google Workspace\nhelps users write, organize, visualize, accelerate workflows, and have richer meetings. Bard allows users to\ncollaborate with experimental AI with new features that include image capabilities, coding support, and app integration.\nDream Screen, a new experimental feature in YouTube, allows for the creation of AI-generated video or image\nbackgrounds to Shorts by typing an idea into a prompt.\n5.",

Products like Performance Max and Product Studio use the full power of\nour AI to help advertisers find untapped and incremental conversion opportunities.\nGoogle Services generates revenues primarily by delivering both performance and brand advertising that appears\non Google Search & other properties, YouTube, and Google Network partners' properties (\"Google Network\nproperties\"). We continue to invest in both performance and brand advertising and seek to improve the measurability of\nadvertising so advertisers understand the effectiveness of their campaigns.\n\u2022 Performance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click on leading to direct\nengagement with advertisers. Performance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while driving\nmeasurable results. Our ads tools allow performance advertisers to create simple text-based ads.\n\u2022 Brand advertising helps enhance users' awareness of and affinity for advertisers' products and services,\nthrough videos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across various devices. We help brand\nadvertisers deliver digital videos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their brand-building marketing\ncampaigns.\nWe have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web.\nWe focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways, including filtering\nout invalid traffic, removing billions of bad ads from our systems every year, and closely monitoring the sites, apps, and\nvideos where ads appear and blocklisting them when necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content.\nIn addition, Google Services increasingly generates revenues from products and services beyond advertising,\nincluding:\n\u2022 consumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such as YouTube TV,\nYouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;\n\u2022 platforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play from the sales of apps and in-app purchases;\nand\n\u2022 devices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices.\nGoogle Cloud\nThrough our Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace offerings, Google Cloud generates revenues\nprimarily from consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, collaboration tools and other\ncloud services. Customers use five key capabilities from Google Cloud.\n\u2022 AI-optimized Infrastructure: provides open, reliable, and scalable compute, networking, and storage to\nenable customers to run workloads anywhere \u2014 on our Cloud, at the edge, or in their data centers. It can be\nused to migrate and modernize IT systems and to train and serve various types of AI models.\n\u2022 Cybersecurity: helps customers detect, protect, and respond to a broad range of cybersecurity threats, with\nAI integrated to further strengthen security outcomes, prioritize which threats to investigate, and identify attack\npaths, as well as accelerate resolution of cybersecurity threats.\n\u2022 Databases and Analytics: provides a variety of different types of databases \u2014 relational, key-value, in-\nmemory \u2014 to store and manage data for different types of applications.

Sustainability is one of\nour core values at Google, and we strive to build sustainability into everything we do. We have been a leader on\nsustainability and climate change since Google\u2019s founding more than 25 years ago.\nOur sustainability work is focused on empowering individuals to take action, working together with our partners\nand customers, and working to reduce our carbon footprint across our operations and supply chain.\nIn 2020, we shared our aspiration to help individuals, cities, and other partners collectively reduce one gigaton of\ntheir carbon equivalent emissions annually by 2030. This is an ambitious vision that we have set to push us to\ncontribute meaningfully to helping with climate solutions beyond our own operations and value chain.\nIn 2021, we set an ambitious goal to achieve net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain, by\n2030. To accomplish this, we aim to reduce 50% of our combined Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), and Scope 3\nabsolute emissions (versus our 2019 baseline) before 2030, and plan to invest in nature-based and technology-based\ncarbon removal solutions to neutralize our remaining emissions. We have formally committed to the Science Based\nTargets initiative to seek their validation of our absolute emissions reduction target.\nOne of the key levers for reducing emissions from our operations is transitioning to clean energy. Since 2017, we\nhave matched 100% of the electricity consumption of our global operations with purchases of renewable energy on an\nannual basis. However, because of differences in the availability of renewable energy sources like solar and wind\nacross the regions where we operate\u2014and because of the variable supply of these resources\u2014we still need to rely on\ncarbon-emitting energy sources that power local grids. That is why we set a goal to run on 24/7 carbon-free energy\n(CFE) on every grid where we operate by 2030.\nAchieving net-zero emissions and 24/7 CFE by 2030 are extremely ambitious goals. We also know that our path\nto net-zero emissions will not be easy or linear. Some of our plans may take years to deliver results, particularly where\nthey involve building new large-scale infrastructure with long lead times. So as our business continues to evolve, we\nexpect our emissions to rise before dropping towards our absolute emissions reduction target.\nTo benefit the people and places where we operate, we have set goals to replenish 120% of the freshwater\nvolume we consume, on average, across our offices and data centers by 2030 and to help restore and improve the\nquality of water and health of ecosystems in the communities where we operate.\nWe also aim to maximize the reuse of finite resources across our operations, products, and supply chains. Our\ncircularity principles focus on designing out waste from the start, keeping materials in use for as long as possible, and\npromoting healthy materials\u2014for our data centers, workplaces, and products.\nMore information on our approach to sustainability can be found in our annual sustainability reports, including\nGoogle\u2019s Environmental Report. The contents of our sustainability reports are not incorporated by reference into this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC. For additional information about\nrisks and uncertainties applicable to our commitments to attain certain sustainability goals, see Item 1A Risk Factors of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCulture and Workforce\nWe are a company of curious, talented, and passionate people. We embrace collaboration and creativity, and\nencourage the iteration of ideas to address complex challenges in technology and society.\nOur people are critical for our continued success, so we work hard to create an environment where employees\ncan have fulfilling careers, and be happy, healthy, and productive. We offer industry-leading benefits and programs to\ntake care of the diverse needs of our employees and their families, including opportunities for career growth and\ndevelopment, resources to support their financial health, and access to excellent healthcare choices. Our competitive\ncompensation programs help us to attract and retain top candidates, and we will continue to invest in recruiting\ntalented people to technical and non-technical roles, and rewarding them well. We provide a variety of high quality\ntraining and support to managers to build and strengthen their capabilities-\u2013ranging from courses for new managers, to\nlearning resources that help them provide feedback and manage performance, to coaching and individual support.\nAt Alphabet, we are committed to making diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do and to growing a\nworkforce that is representative of the users we serve.

In\naddition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international operations expose us to other risks, including the\nfollowing:\n\u2022 restrictions on foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent\nus from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.;\n\u2022 sanctions, import and export controls, other market access barriers, political unrest, geopolitical tensions,\nchanges in regimes, or armed conflict (such as ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine), any of which\nmay affect our business continuity, increase our operating costs, limit demand for our products and services,\nlimit our ability to source components or final products, or prevent or impede us from operating in certain\njurisdictions, complying with local laws, or offering products or services;\n\u2022 longer payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud;\n\u2022 an evolving foreign policy landscape that may adversely affect our revenues and could subject us to litigation,\nnew regulatory costs and challenges (including new customer requirements), uncertainty regarding regulatory\noutcomes, and other liabilities under local laws that may not offer due process or clear legal precedent;\n\u2022 anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting certain\npayments to government officials, violations of which could result in civil and criminal penalties; and\n\u2022 different employee/employer relationships, existence of works councils and differing labor practices, and other\nchallenges caused by distance, language, local expertise, and cultural differences, increasing the complexity\nof doing business in multiple jurisdictions.\nBecause we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results in U.S. dollars,\nwe have faced, and will continue to face, exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Although we\nhedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S.\ndollar and foreign currencies have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our revenues and earnings.\nHedging programs are also inherently risky and could expose us to additional risks that could harm our financial\ncondition and operating results.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in the fair values of our investments and, in some instances, our financial\nstatements incorporate inherently subjective valuation methodologies.\nThe fair value of our debt and equity investments may in the future be, and certain investments have been in the\npast, negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, performance and financial results of the underlying\nentities, foreign exchange rates, changes in interest rates, including changes that may result from the implementation\nof new benchmark rates, the effect of new or changing regulations, the stock market in general, or other factors.\nWe measure certain of our non-marketable equity and debt securities, certain other instruments including stock-\nbased compensation awards settled in the stock of Other Bet companies, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in\na business combination, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, which is inherently subjective and requires management\njudgment and estimation. All gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities are recognized in OI&E, which\nincreases the volatility of our OI&E. The unrealized gains and losses or impairments we record from fair value\nremeasurements in any particular period may differ significantly from the gains or losses we ultimately realize on such\ninvestments.\nAs a result of these factors, the value of our investments could decline, which could harm our financial condition\nand operating results.\nRisks Related to our Industry\nPeople access our products and services through a variety of platforms and devices that continue to\nevolve with the advancement of technology and user preferences. If manufacturers and users do not widely\nadopt versions of our products and services developed for these interfaces, our business could be harmed.\nPeople access our products and services through a growing variety of devices such as desktop computers,\nmobile phones, smartphones, laptops and tablets, video game consoles, voice-activated speakers, wearables\n(including virtual reality and augmented reality devices), automobiles, and television-streaming devices. Our products\nand services may be less popular on some interfaces. Each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical\nstandards for its devices, and our products and services may not be available or may only be available with limited\nfunctionality for our users or our advertisers on these devices as a result.

We continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our\nproducts and advertising programs relevant to our users in these markets. This has led to a trend of increased\nrevenues from emerging markets. We expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these\nmarkets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available. This trend could affect our revenues as\ndeveloping markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets.\nInternational revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a foreign exchange risk management program\ndesigned to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues\nand earnings.\n\u2022 The revenues that we derive beyond advertising are increasing and may adversely affect our margins.\nRevenues from cloud, consumer subscriptions, platforms, and devices, which may have differing characteristics\nthan our advertising revenues, have grown over time, and we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding\nour products and services. The margins on these revenues vary significantly and are generally lower than the margins\non our advertising revenues. For example, sales of our devices adversely affect our consolidated margins due to\npressures on pricing and higher cost of sales.\n\u2022 As we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and\ncapital expenditures.\nWe continue to make significant research and development investments in areas of strategic focus as we seek to\ndevelop new, innovative offerings, improve our existing offerings, and rapidly and responsibly deploy AI across our\nbusinesses. We also expect to increase, relative to 2023, our investment in our technical infrastructure, including\nservers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term initiatives, in\nparticular in support of AI products and services. In addition, acquisitions and strategic investments contribute to the\nbreadth and depth of our offerings, expand our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, and build strong\npartnerships around strategic initiatives.\n\u2022 We continue to face an evolving regulatory environment, and we are subject to claims, lawsuits,\ninvestigations, and other forms of potential legal liability, which could affect our business practices and\nfinancial results.\nChanges in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide\nrange of topics and related legal matters, including investigations, lawsuits, and regulatory actions, have resulted in\nfines and caused us to change our business practices. As these global trends continue, our cost of doing business may\nincrease, our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products or services may be limited, and we\nmay need to change our business practices to comply with evolving regulatory and legal matters. Examples include the\nantitrust complaints filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and a number of state Attorneys General; legislative\nproposals and pending litigation in the U.S., EU, and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor\nprotection for websites and online platforms; and the Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act in Europe and various\nlegislative proposals in the U.S. focused on large technology platforms.

Workforce Reduction and Other Initiatives\nWe have a company-wide effort underway to re-engineer our cost base. As part of this program, in January 2023,\nwe announced a reduction of our workforce. As a result, total employee severance and related charges recorded\nduring the year ended December 31, 2023 were $2.1 billion. Substantially all of the employees affected were no longer\nincluded in our headcount as of December 31, 2023.\nIn addition, we are taking actions to optimize our global office space. As a result, exit charges recorded during the\nyear ended December 31, 2023, were $1.8 billion as reflected in the table below. In addition to these exit charges, for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred $269 million in accelerated rent and accelerated depreciation, which\nare not included in the table below.\nSeverance and office space exit charges are included within our consolidated statements of income as follows (in\nmillions):\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nSeverance\nand Related (1) Office Space Total\nCost of revenues $ 479 $ 481 $ 960\nResearch and development 848 870 1,718\nSales and marketing 497 257 754\nGeneral and administrative 264 237 501\nTotal charges $ 2,088 $ 1,845 $ 3,933\n(1) Severance includes amounts to be settled in cash, accounted for as one-time involuntary employee termination benefits, and\nSBC.\nFor segment reporting, the substantial majority of these charges are included within Alphabet-level activities in our\nsegment results.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, changes in liabilities resulting from the severance charges and related\naccruals were as follows (in millions):\nSeverance and\nRelated\nBalance as of December 31, 2022 $ 0\nCharges(1) 1,656\nCash payments (1,579)\nBalance as of December 31, 2023(2) $ 77\n(1) Excludes non-cash SBC of $432 million.\n(2) Included in accrued compensation and benefits on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n76.",

International revenues accounted for approximately 51% of our consolidated revenues in 2024. In\naddition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international operations expose us to other risks, including the\nfollowing:\n\u2022 restrictions on foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent\nus from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.;\n\u2022 sanctions, import and export controls, other market access barriers, political unrest, geopolitical tensions,\nchanges in regimes, or armed conflict (such as ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine), any of which\nmay affect our business continuity, increase our operating costs, limit demand for our products and services,\nlimit our ability to source components or final products, or prevent or impede us from operating in certain\njurisdictions, complying with local laws, or offering products or services;\n\u2022 longer payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud;\n\u2022 an evolving foreign policy landscape that could harm our revenues and could subject us to litigation, new\nregulatory costs and challenges (including new customer requirements), uncertainty regarding regulatory\noutcomes, and other liabilities under local laws that may not offer due process or clear legal precedent;\n\u2022 anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting certain\npayments to government officials, violations of which could result in civil and criminal penalties; and\n\u2022 different employee/employer relationships; different labor laws, regulations, and labor practices; and other\nchallenges caused by distance, language, local expertise, and cultural differences, increasing the complexity\nof doing business in multiple jurisdictions.\nBecause we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results in U.S. dollars,\nwe have faced, and will continue to face, exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Although we\nhedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S.\ndollar and foreign currencies have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our revenues and earnings.\nHedging programs are also inherently risky and could expose us to additional risks that could harm our financial\ncondition and operating results.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in the fair values of our investments and, in some instances, our financial\nstatements incorporate inherently subjective valuation methodologies.\nThe fair value of our debt and equity investments may in the future be, and certain investments have been in the\npast, negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, performance and financial results of the underlying\nentities, foreign exchange rates, changes in interest rates, the effect of new or changing regulations, the stock market\nin general, or other factors.\nWe measure certain of our non-marketable equity and debt securities, certain other instruments including stock-\nbased compensation awards settled in the stock of Other Bet companies, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in\na business combination, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, which is inherently subjective and requires management\njudgment and estimation. All gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities are recognized in OI&E, which\nincreases the volatility of our OI&E. The unrealized gains and losses or impairments we record from fair value\nremeasurements in any particular period may differ significantly from the gains and losses we ultimately realize on\nsuch investments.\nAs a result of these factors, the value of our investments could decline, which could harm our financial condition\nand operating results.\nRisks Related to our Industry\nPeople access our products and services through a variety of platforms and devices that continue to\nevolve with the advancement of technology and user preferences. If manufacturers and users do not widely\nadopt versions of our products and services developed for these interfaces, our business could be harmed.\nPeople access our products and services through a growing variety of devices such as desktop computers,\nphones, laptops and tablets, video game consoles, voice-activated speakers, wearables (including virtual reality and\naugmented reality devices), automobiles, and television-streaming devices. Our products and services may be less\npopular on some interfaces. Each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices,\nand our products and services may not be available or may only be available with limited functionality for our users or\nour advertisers on these devices as a result. Some manufacturers may also elect not to include our products on their\ndevices.\n15.",

We expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these\nmarkets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available. This trend could affect our revenues as\ndeveloping markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets.\nInternational revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a foreign exchange risk management program\ndesigned to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues\nand earnings.\n\u2022 The revenues that we derive beyond advertising are increasing and may adversely affect our margins.\nRevenues from cloud, consumer subscriptions, platforms, and devices, which may have differing characteristics\nthan our advertising revenues, have grown over time, and we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding\nour products and services. The margins on these revenues vary significantly and are generally lower than the margins\non our advertising revenues. For example, sales of our devices adversely affect our consolidated margins due to\npressures on pricing and higher cost of sales.\n\u2022 As we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and\ncapital expenditures.\nWe continue to make significant research and development investments in areas of strategic focus as we seek to\ndevelop new, innovative offerings, improve our existing offerings, and rapidly and responsibly deploy AI across our\nbusinesses. We also expect to increase, relative to 2024, our investment in our technical infrastructure, including\nservers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term initiatives, in\nparticular in support of AI products and services. In addition, acquisitions and strategic investments remain important\nelements in our use of capital and contribute to the breadth and depth of our offerings, expand our expertise in\nengineering and other functional areas, and build strong partnerships around strategic initiatives.\n\u2022 We continue to face an evolving regulatory environment, and we are subject to claims, lawsuits,\ninvestigations, and other forms of potential legal liability, which could affect our business practices and\nfinancial results.\nChanges in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide\nrange of topics and related legal matters, including investigations, lawsuits, and regulatory actions, have resulted in\nfines and caused us to change our business practices. As these global trends continue, our cost of doing business may\nincrease, our products and services may become less useful, our ability to pursue certain business practices or offer\ncertain products or services may be limited, and we may need to change our business models and operations to\ncomply with evolving regulatory and legal matters.

We expect to continue\nhiring talented employees around the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs. For additional\ninformation, see Culture and Workforce in Part I, Item 1 Business of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenues and Monetization Metrics\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide\nenterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure, platform services, and applications; sales of other products and\nservices, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and devices. For\nadditional information on how we recognize revenue, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition to the long-term trends and their financial effect on our business discussed above, fluctuations in our\nrevenues have been and may continue to be affected by a combination of factors, including:\n\u2022 changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022 changes in pricing, such as those resulting from changes in fee structures, discounts, and customer incentives;\n\u2022 general economic conditions and various external dynamics, including geopolitical events, regulations, and\nother measures and their effect on advertiser, consumer, and enterprise spending;\n\u2022 new product, service, and market launches; and\n31.",

These services provide access to solutions such as AI offerings including our AI\ninfrastructure, Vertex AI platform, and Gemini for Google Cloud; cybersecurity; and data and analytics;\n\u2022 Google Workspace, which includes subscriptions for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for\nenterprises, such as Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Drive, and Meet, with integrated features like Gemini for Google\nWorkspace; and\n\u2022 other enterprise services.\nFluctuations in our Google Cloud revenues have been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition to\nthe general factors described above, such as changes in customer usage and demand.\nOther Bets\nRevenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services, and internet\nservices.\nCosts and Expenses\nOur cost structure has two components: cost of revenues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses\ninclude costs related to R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of our costs and\nexpenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our\noperating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. Additionally,\nfluctuations in employee compensation expenses may not directly correlate with changes in headcount, due to factors\nsuch as annual stock-based compensation (SBC) awards that generally vest over four years.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues.\n\u2022 TAC includes:\n\u25e6 amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services.\nOur distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers,\nand software developers; and\n\u25e6 amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n\u2022 Other cost of revenues primarily includes:\n\u25e6 content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and\nother content for distribution, primarily related to YouTube (we pay fees to these content providers\nbased on revenues generated, subscriber counts, or a flat fee);\n\u25e6 depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure;\n\u25e6 employee compensation expenses related to our technical infrastructure and other operations such as\ncontent review and customer and product support;\n\u25e6 inventory and other costs related to the devices we sell; and\n\u25e6 other technical infrastructure operations costs, including network capacity, energy, and equipment\ncosts.\nTAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly\nhigher than TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search & other properties,\nbecause most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our\nGoogle Network partners.\nOperating Expenses\n33.",

The increase in operating income\nwas primarily driven by an increase in revenues, partially offset by increases in content acquisition costs and TAC.\nAdditionally, a reduction in employee compensation expenses contributed to the increase in operating income.\nGoogle Cloud\nGoogle Cloud operating income increased $4.4 billion from 2023 to 2024. The increase in operating income was\nprimarily driven by an increase in revenues, partially offset by increases in usage costs for technical infrastructure as\nwell as employee compensation expenses, largely driven by headcount growth.\nOther Bets\nOther Bets operating loss increased $349 million from 2023 to 2024. The increase in operating loss was primarily\ndue to an increase in expenses, largely driven by employee compensation expenses in addition to a combination of\nfactors, none of which were individually significant. The increase in employee compensation expenses was primarily as\na result of the reduction in valuation-based compensation liabilities related to certain Other Bets recognized in the prior\nyear comparable period.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nThe following table presents OI&E, (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2024\nInterest income $ 3,865 $ 4,482\nInterest expense (308) (268)\nForeign currency exchange gain (loss), net (1,238) (409)\nGain (loss) on debt securities, net (1,215) (1,043)\nGain (loss) on equity securities, net 392 3,714\nPerformance fees 257 218\nIncome (loss) and impairment from equity method investments, net (628) (188)\nOther 299 919\nOther income (expense), net $ 1,424 $ 7,425\nOI&E, net increased $6.0 billion from 2023 to 2024 primarily due to an increase in net gains on equity securities\nand a decrease in net losses on foreign currency exchange. The net gains on equity securities were primarily due to\nnet unrealized gains on non-marketable equity securities driven by fair value adjustments related to observable\ntransactions, partially offset by a decrease in net unrealized gains on marketable equity securities due to market-driven\nchanges. Foreign currency exchange net losses decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to prior year\nlosses in unhedged currencies.\nIn January 2025, we recognized an $8.0 billion unrealized gain on our non-marketable equity securities related to\nour investment in a private company. The unrealized gain reflects an increase in the fair value measurement of our\ninvestment following an observable transaction in January 2025.\nFor additional information, see Note 3 and Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in\nItem 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe following table presents provision for income taxes (in millions, except effective tax rate):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2024\nIncome before provision for income taxes $ 85,717 $ 119,815\nProvision for income taxes $ 11,922 $ 19,697\nEffective tax rate 13.9 % 16.4 %\nThe effective tax rate increased from 2023 to 2024. This increase was primarily due to a one-time adjustment for\ntax rule changes issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that affected the 2023 rate related to U.S. federal\nforeign tax credits, as well as a separate rule change with guidance on the capitalization and amortization of R&D\n40.",

These direct actions did not have a material\neffect on our financial results. The ongoing broader economic effects resulting from the war in Ukraine on\nour future financial results may be unpredictable.\n\u2022 We entered into an agreement to acquire Mandiant, a leader in dynamic cyber defense and response, in\nMarch 2022 for $23.00 per share, in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $5.4 billion, net of cash\nand debt. See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.\n\u2022 Repurchases of Class A and Class C shares were $13.3 billion. In April 2022, the Board of Directors of\nAlphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C\nshares. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.\n\u2022 The company announced in February 2022 that the Board of Directors had approved and declared a 20-for-\none stock split in the form of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the company\u2019s Class A,\nClass B, and Class C stock. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in\nItem 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.\n\u2022 Operating cash flow was $25.1 billion, primarily driven by revenues generated from our advertising\nproducts.\n\u2022 Capital expenditures of $9.8 billion reflects the increase in purchases of office facilities.\n33",

Hedging gains contributed approximately one percentage point to consolidated revenue\ngrowth.\n\u2022 Total constant currency revenues, which exclude the effect of hedging, increased 11% year over year\nreflecting the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.\n\u2022 Cost of revenues was $31.2 billion, an increase of 13% year over year, primarily driven by an increase in\nother costs of revenues.\n\u2022 Operating expenses were $20.8 billion, an increase of 26% year over year, primarily driven by increases in\ncompensation expenses due to headcount growth and advertising and promotional expenses.\nOther information\n\u2022 On September 12, 2022 we closed the acquisition of Mandiant for a total purchase price of $6.1 billion and\nadded over 2,600 employees. Mandiant's financial results are reported within Google Cloud as of the\nacquisition date. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.\n\u2022 Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, we suspended the vast majority of our commercial activities in Russia\nand effectively ceased business activities of our Russian entity. The ongoing effect of these direct actions on\nour financial results was not material. The broader economic effects resulting from the war in Ukraine on our\nfuture financial results may be unpredictable.\n\u2022 Repurchases of Class A and Class C shares were $15.4 billion for the three months ended September 30,\n2022. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q for additional information.\n\u2022 Operating cash flow was $23.4 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2022.\n\u2022 Capital expenditures of $7.3 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2022 primarily relate to\ninvestments in technical infrastructure.\n37",
