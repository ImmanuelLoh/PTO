        "text": "Financial filing text section: Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\nOur marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds and our non-marketable equity securities are\ninvestments in privately held companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages.\nWe record marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily\ndeterminable market values, of which publicly traded stocks and mutual funds are subject to market price volatility, and\nrepresent $7.8 billion and $5.2 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. A\nhypothetical adverse price change of 10% on our December 31, 2022 balance would decrease the fair value of\nmarketable equity securities by $516 million. From time to time, we may enter into derivatives to hedge the market\nprice risk on certain of our marketable equity securities.\nOur non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are adjusted to fair value for\nobservable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the\nmeasurement alternative). The fair value measured at the time of the observable transaction is not necessarily an\nindication of the current fair value as of the balance sheet date. These investments, especially those that are in the\nearly stages, are inherently risky because the technologies or products these companies have under development are\ntypically in the early phases and may never materialize, and they may experience a decline in financial condition,\nwhich could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. Valuations of our equity\ninvestments in private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data and\nobservable transactions at lower valuations could result in significant losses. In addition, global economic conditions\ncould result in additional volatility. The success of our investment in any private company is also typically dependent on\nthe likelihood of our ability to realize appreciation in the value of investments through liquidity events such as public\nofferings, acquisitions, private sales or other market events. Changes in the valuation of non-marketable equity\nsecurities may not directly correlate with changes in valuation of marketable equity securities. As of December 31,\n2021 and 2022, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities, which were accounted for under the\nmeasurement alternative, was $27.6 billion and $28.5 billion, respectively.\nThe carrying values of our equity method investments, which totaled approximately $1.5 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2022, generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes. However, these investments\ncould be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value and is not expected to recover.\nFor further information about our equity investments, see Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n42",

Where applicable,\nthese models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based\nobservable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities.\nThe fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of\nunobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The determination of fair value involves the use of appropriate\nvaluation methods and relevant inputs into valuation models.\nOur financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents,\nmarketable securities, derivative financial instruments, and certain non-marketable debt securities. Our financial assets\nmeasured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include non-marketable equity securities. Other financial assets and\nliabilities are carried at cost with fair value disclosed, if required.\nWe measure certain other instruments, including stock-based compensation awards settled in the stock of certain\nOther Bets, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, also at fair value on a nonrecurring\nbasis.\nFinancial Instruments\nOur financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents, marketable and non-marketable securities, derivative\nfinancial instruments and accounts receivable.\nCredit Risks\nWe are subject to credit risk from cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivative financial instruments,\nincluding foreign exchange contracts, and accounts receivable. We manage our credit risk exposure through timely\nassessment of our counterparty creditworthiness, credit limits and use of collateral management. Foreign exchange\ncontracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing. Accounts receivable are typically\nunsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the world. We manage our credit risk\nexposure by performing ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the amount of credit we extend.\nWe generally do not require collateral from our customers.\nCash Equivalents\nWe invest excess cash primarily in government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-\nbacked securities, time deposits, and money market funds.\nMarketable Securities\nWe classify all marketable debt securities that have effective maturities of three months or less from the date of\npurchase as cash equivalents and those with effective maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities\non our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable\ndebt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. We have\nclassified and accounted for our marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. After consideration of our risk versus\nreward objectives, as well as our liquidity requirements, we may sell these debt securities prior to their effective\nmaturities. As we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify highly liquid securities\nwith maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets. We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a\ncomponent of stockholders\u2019 equity, except for the changes in allowance for expected credit losses, which are recorded\nin other income (expense), net. For certain marketable debt securities we have elected the fair value option, for which\nchanges in fair value are recorded in other income (expense), net. We determine any realized gains or losses on the\nsale of marketable debt securities on a specific identification method, and we record such gains and losses as a\ncomponent of other income (expense), net.\nOur investments in marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with the related gains and losses,\nincluding unrealized, recognized in other income (expense), net.

The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or\nservices and customers, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer.\nAdditionally, accounts receivable includes amounts for services performed in advance of the right to invoice the\ncustomer.\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable, which is recorded as an offset to accounts\nreceivable, and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements\nof Income. We assess collectibility by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics\nexist and on an individual basis when we identify specific customers with known disputes or collectibility issues. In\ndetermining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we consider historical collectibility based on past due status\nand make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also consider\ncustomer-specific information, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic\nconditions.\nOther\nOur financial instruments also include debt and equity investments in companies with which we also have\ncommercial arrangements. For these transactions, judgment is required to assess the substance of the arrangements,\nwhether the arrangements and each component of the arrangements should be accounted for as separate\ntransactions under the applicable GAAP, as well as the determination of the value of the components of the\narrangements, including the fair value of the investments.\nImpairment of Investments\nWe periodically review our debt and non-marketable equity securities for impairment.\nFor debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists. The credit loss is\nestimated by considering available information relevant to the collectibility of the security and information about past\nevents, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Any credit loss is recorded as a charge to other\nincome (expense), net, not to exceed the amount of the unrealized loss. Unrealized losses other than the credit loss\nare recognized in AOCI. If we have an intent to sell, or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a debt\nsecurity in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis, we will write down the security to its\nfair value and record the corresponding charge as a component of other income (expense), net.\nFor non-marketable equity securities, including equity method investments, we consider whether impairment\nindicators exist by evaluating the companies' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among\nother indicators. If the assessment indicates that the investment is impaired, we write down the investment to its fair\nvalue by recording the corresponding charge as a component of other income (expense), net. We prepare quantitative\nmeasurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income approach.\n56",

Cost is\ncomputed using the first-in, first-out method.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in\nwhich we have other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity (VIE). We consolidate VIEs when we are\nthe primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have the power to direct activities that most\nsignificantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses\nor benefits. If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a\nVIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.\nPeriodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination\nof whether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment includes the following categories: land and buildings, information technology assets,\nconstruction in progress, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures. Land and buildings include land, offices,\ndata centers, and related building improvements. Information technology assets include servers and network\nequipment. Construction in progress is the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet\nbeen placed in service.\nWe account for property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation. We compute depreciation using\nthe straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which we regularly evaluate. Land is not\ndepreciated. We depreciate buildings over periods of seven to 25 years. We depreciate information technology assets\ngenerally over periods of four to five years (generally, four years for servers and five years for network equipment). We\ndepreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the\nassets. Depreciation for buildings, information technology assets, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures\ncommences once they are ready for our intended use.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-\nlease components. Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed. Non-lease components primarily\ninclude payments for maintenance and utilities. We combine fixed payments for non-lease components with lease\npayments and account for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets\nand liabilities.\nCertain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the\nlease assets and liabilities. These amounts include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index, payments\ncontingent on wind or solar production for power purchase arrangements, and payments for maintenance and utilities.\nLease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease\ncommencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our\nincremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable. Our incremental\nborrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments,\nand in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Our lease terms include periods under options to\nextend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally use the\nbase, non-cancelable, lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. Lease assets also include any\nprepaid lease payments and lease incentives.\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The current portion of our\noperating lease liabilities is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and the long-term portion is\nincluded in operating lease liabilities. Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment, net. Finance lease\nliabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or long-term debt.\nOperating lease expense (excluding variable lease costs) is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease\nterm.\nLong-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets\nWe review property and equipment and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment when events or\nchanges in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the\nlowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. We measure recoverability of these assets by\n57",

If the carrying value of the assets or asset group is not recoverable, the impairment recognized is\nmeasured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Impairments were not material for the\nperiods presented.\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. We\nevaluate our reporting units periodically, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in\nreporting units, we reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. We test our goodwill for\nimpairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be\nimpaired. Goodwill impairments were not material for the periods presented.\nIntangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis\ngenerally over periods ranging from one to twelve years, and are subsequently removed from the presentation of gross\nintangible assets and accumulated amortization once they are fully amortized.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which we recognize the amount of taxes\npayable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of\nevents that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We measure current and deferred tax\nassets and liabilities based on provisions of enacted tax law.

The tax benefits of the position recognized in the\nfinancial statements are then measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be\nrealized upon settlement with a taxing authority. In addition, we recognize interest and penalties related to\nunrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the acquisition date. We allocate the\npurchase price of the acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values,\nexcept for revenue contracts acquired, which are recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The\nexcess of the purchase price over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\nForeign Currency\nWe translate the financial statements of our international subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange\nrates for assets and liabilities, and average rates for the annual period derived from month-end exchange rates for\nrevenues, costs, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in AOCI as a component of stockholders\u2019\nequity. We reflect net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction\ncurrency to functional currency as a component of foreign currency exchange gain (loss) in other income (expense),\nnet.\nPrior Period Reclassifications\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.\n58",

Future lease payments under operating leases as of December 31, 2022\nwere as follows (in millions):\n2023 $ 2,955\n2024 2,771\n2025 2,377\n2026 1,953\n2027 1,502\nThereafter 5,882\nTotal future lease payments 17,440\nLess imputed interest (2,462)\nTotal lease liability balance $ 14,978\nAs of December 31, 2022, we have entered into leases that have not yet commenced with short-term and long-\nterm future lease payments of $630 million and $3.1 billion that are not yet recorded on our Consolidated Balance\nSheets. These leases will commence between 2023 and 2026 with non-cancelable lease terms between 1 and 25\nyears.\nNote 5. Variable Interest Entities\nConsolidated VIEs\nWe consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of\noperations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.\nFor certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us and their creditors do not have recourse to us.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2022, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $6.0 billion\nand $4.1 billion, respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs were $2.5 billion and\n$2.6 billion, respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs that are included within Other\nBets.\nTotal noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were $4.3 billion and $3.8 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively, of which $1.1 billion is redeemable noncontrolling interest (RNCI) for both\nperiods. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests\nwas not material for any period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of OI&E. See Note 7 for further\ndetails on OI&E.\nUnconsolidated VIEs\nWe have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private companies\nthat are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve power\ngeneration using renewable sources.\nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that\nwould significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results of\noperations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We account\nfor these investments as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments.\nThe maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the\ninvestments and any future funding commitments. We have determined that the single source of our exposure to these\nVIEs is our capital investments in them. The carrying value and maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs were\n$2.7 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2021 and $2.7 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, as of\nDecember 31, 2022.\nNote 6. Debt\nShort-Term Debt\nWe have a debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds\nfrom this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as of\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2022.\nOur short-term debt balance also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt.\n68",

We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP\npercentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for financial\nand operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the\npresentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles\n(GAAP) results helps improve the ability to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign\ncurrency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant\nperiod over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency\nexchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level.\nWe use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year\nbasis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable\nperiod exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.\nConstant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period\nrevenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated\nusing prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods.\nThese results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with\nGAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures\nused by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table presents the foreign currency exchange effect on international revenues and total revenues (in\nmillions, except percentages):\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\n% Change from Prior Period\nYear Ended December 31, Constant Less Constant\nLess FX Currency As Hedging Less FX Currency\n2022 2023 Effect Revenues Reported Effect Effect Revenues\nUnited States $ 134,814 $ 146,286 $ 0 $ 146,286 9 % 0 % 9 %\nEMEA 82,062 91,038 460 90,578 11 % 1 % 10 %\nAPAC 47,024 51,514 (1,759) 53,273 10 % (3) % 13 %\nOther Americas 16,976 18,320 (654) 18,974 8 % (4) % 12 %\nRevenues, excluding hedging effect 280,876 307,158 (1,953) 309,111 9 % (1) % 10 %\nHedging gains (losses) 1,960 236\nTotal revenues(1) $ 282,836 $ 307,394 $ 309,111 9 % 0 % (1) % 10 %\n(1) Total constant currency revenues of $309.1 billion for 2023 increased $28.2 billion compared to $280.9 billion in revenues,\nexcluding hedging effect, for 2022.\nEMEA revenue growth was favorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the\nU.S. dollar weakening relative to the Euro, partially offset by the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Turkish lira.\nAPAC revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to\nthe U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Japanese yen.\nOther Americas revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates,\nprimarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Argentine peso.\n37.",

If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a\nVIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.\nPeriodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination\nof whether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment includes the following categories: land and buildings, information technology assets,\nconstruction in progress, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures. Land and buildings include land, offices,\ndata centers, and related building improvements. Information technology assets include servers and network\nequipment. Construction in progress is the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet\nbeen placed in service.\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recorded using the\nstraight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which we regularly evaluate. Land is not depreciated.\nWe depreciate buildings over periods of seven to 25 years. We depreciate information technology assets generally\nover a period of six years for servers and network equipment. We depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter\nof the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation for buildings, information\ntechnology assets, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures commences once they are ready for our\nintended use.\nGoodwill\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. We\nevaluate our reporting units periodically, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in\nreporting units, we reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. We test our goodwill for\nimpairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be\nimpaired. Goodwill impairments were not material for the periods presented.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-\nlease components. Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed. Non-lease components primarily\ninclude payments for maintenance and utilities. We combine fixed payments for non-lease components with lease\npayments and account for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets\nand liabilities.\nCertain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the\nlease assets and liabilities. These amounts primarily include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index, and\npayments for maintenance and utilities.\nLease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease\ncommencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our\nincremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable. Our incremental\nborrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments,\nand in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Our lease terms include periods under options to\nextend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally use the\nbase, non-cancelable, lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. Lease assets also include any\nprepaid lease payments and lease incentives.\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The current portion of our\noperating lease liabilities is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and the long-term portion is\nincluded in operating lease liabilities. Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment, net. Finance lease\nliabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or long-term debt.\nOperating lease expense (excluding variable lease costs) is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease\nterm.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review leases, property and equipment, and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment when\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed\nat the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. We measure recoverability of these assets by\ncomparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected\n61.",

If the carrying value of the assets or asset group is not recoverable, the impairment recognized is\nmeasured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which we recognize the amount of taxes\npayable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of\nevents that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We measure current and deferred tax\nassets and liabilities based on provisions of enacted tax law. We evaluate the likelihood of future realization of our\ndeferred tax assets based on all available evidence and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets\nwhen it is more likely than not that they will not be realized or release a valuation allowance to increase deferred tax\nassets when it is more likely than not that they will be realized. We have elected to account for the tax effects of the\nglobal intangible low tax Income provision as a current period expense.\nWe recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that, based on\ntechnical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The tax benefits of the position recognized in the\nfinancial statements are then measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be\nrealized upon settlement with a taxing authority. In addition, we recognize interest and penalties related to\nunrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the acquisition date. We allocate the\npurchase price of the acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values,\nexcept for revenue contracts acquired, which are recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The\nexcess of the purchase price over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\nForeign Currency\nWe translate the financial statements of our international subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange\nrates for assets and liabilities, and average rates for the annual period derived from month-end exchange rates for\nrevenues, costs, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in AOCI as a component of stockholders\u2019\nequity. We reflect net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction\ncurrency to functional currency as a component of foreign currency exchange gain (loss) in OI&E.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Standards Accounting Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update\n(ASU) 2023-07 \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280):Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\" which expands\nannual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about\nsignificant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2024, and for\ninterim periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential\neffect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 \"Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures\" to expand the disclosure requirements for income taxes, specifically related to the rate reconciliation and\nincome taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption\npermitted. We are currently evaluating the potential effect that the updated standard will have on our financial\nstatement disclosures.\nPrior Period Reclassifications\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.\n62.",

These leases will commence between 2024 and 2026 with non-cancelable lease terms between one and 25\nyears.\nNote 5. Variable Interest Entities\nConsolidated Variable Interest Entities\nWe consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of\noperations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.\nFor certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us and their creditors do not have recourse to us.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2023, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $4.1 billion\nand $4.9 billion, respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs were $2.6 billion and\n$2.5 billion, respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs that are included within Other\nBets.\nTotal noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were $3.8 billion and $3.4 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively, of which $1.1 billion is redeemable noncontrolling interest (RNCI) for both\nperiods. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests\nwas not material for any period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of OI&E. See Note 7 for further\ndetails on OI&E.\nUnconsolidated Variable Interest Entities\nWe have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private companies\nthat are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve power\ngeneration using renewable sources.\nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that\nwould significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results of\noperations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We account\nfor these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments.\nThe maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the\ninvestments and any future funding commitments. The maximum exposure and carrying value of these unconsolidated\nVIEs were $2.8 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2022 and $5.7 billion and $4.0 billion,\nrespectively, as of December 31, 2023. The difference between the maximum exposure and the carrying value relates\nprimarily to future funding commitments.\nNote 6. Debt\nShort-Term Debt\nWe have a debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds\nfrom this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2023.\nOur short-term debt balance also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt.\n72.",

In certain instances, the amount of our contractual obligations may change based on the\nexpected timing of order fulfillment from our suppliers. For more information related to our content licenses, see Note\n10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition, we regularly enter into multi-year, non-cancellable agreements to purchase renewable energy and\nenergy attributes, such as renewable energy certificates. These agreements do not include a minimum dollar\ncommitment. The amounts to be paid under these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated and\nare not readily determinable.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In doing so, we have to make\nestimates and assumptions. Our critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of\nuncertainty at the time the estimate was made, and changes in them have had or are reasonably likely to have a\nmaterial effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from\nour estimates. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable\nunder the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We have reviewed our critical\naccounting estimates with the Audit and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors.\nFor a summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements, see Note 1 of the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFair Value Measurements of Non-Marketable Equity Securities\nWe measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, consisting primarily of our non-\nmarketable equity securities. These investments are accounted for under the measurement alternative method (\"the\nmeasurement alternative\") and are measured at cost, less impairment, subject to upward and downward adjustments\nresulting from observable price changes for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. These adjustments\nrequire quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities, which may require the use of unobservable inputs.\nAdjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date and involve the use of\nestimates using the best information available, which may include cash flow projections or other available market data.\nNon-marketable equity securities are also evaluated for impairment, based on qualitative factors including the\ncompanies' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among others. When indicators of\nimpairment exist, we prepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market\napproach or an income approach, which requires judgment and the use of unobservable inputs, including discount\nrates, investee revenues and costs, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others.\nWhen the quantitative remeasurements of fair value indicate an impairment exists, we write down the investment to its\ncurrent fair value.\nWe also have compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain investments, i.e.\nperformance fees. We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may\nresult in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use\nof unobservable inputs.\nProperty and Equipment\nWe assess the reasonableness of the useful lives of our property and equipment periodically as well as when\nother changes occur, such as when there are changes to ongoing business operations, changes in the planned use\nand utilization of assets, or technological advancements, that could indicate a change in the period over which we\nexpect to benefit from the asset.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating\nour uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.\nRecording an uncertain tax position involves various qualitative considerations, including evaluation of\ncomparable and resolved tax exposures, applicability of tax laws, and likelihood of settlement. We evaluate uncertain\ntax positions periodically, considering changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial\nopinions, as well as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities. Although we believe we have adequately\nreserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not\nbe different. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such\n44.",

The change in the value recorded in AOCI would be expected to offset a\ncorresponding foreign currency change in forecasted hedged revenues when recognized.\nWe use foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency\nrisks related to investment in foreign subsidiaries. These forward contracts serve to offset the foreign currency\ntranslation risk from our foreign operations.\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10%, the amount recorded in cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) within AOCI\nrelated to our net investment hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $946 million and $660 million\nlower as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. The change in value recorded in CTA would be expected to\noffset a corresponding foreign currency translation gain or loss from our investment in foreign subsidiaries.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur Corporate Treasury investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and\nmaintain liquidity. We invest primarily in debt securities, including government bonds, corporate debt securities,\nmortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, money market and other funds, time deposits, and interest rate\nderivatives. By policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and\nfloating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair\nmarket value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income\nthan predicted if interest rates fall. Unrealized gains and losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to\ninterest rate fluctuations as compared to interest rates at the time of purchase. For certain fixed and variable rate debt\nsecurities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in OI&E. We measure\nsecurities for which we have not elected the fair value option at fair value with gains and losses recorded in AOCI until\nthe securities are sold, less any expected credit losses.\nWe use value-at-risk (VaR) analysis to determine the potential effect of fluctuations in interest rates on the value\nof our investment portfolio. The VaR is the expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, for our\ninvestment portfolio due to adverse movements in interest rates. We use a variance/covariance VaR model with 95%\nconfidence interval. The estimated one-day loss in fair value of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2023 and\n2024 are shown below (in millions):\n12-Month Average\nAs of December 31, As of December 31,\n2023 2024 2023 2024\nRisk category - interest rate $ 296 $ 208 $ 271 $ 230\nActual future gains and losses associated with our investment portfolio may differ materially from the sensitivity\nanalyses performed as of December 31, 2023 and 2024 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the\ntiming and amount of changes in interest rates and our actual exposures and positions. VaR analysis is not intended to\nrepresent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation.\nEquity Investment Risk\nOur marketable and non-marketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that\ncould substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings.\nOur marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds and our non-marketable equity securities are\ninvestments in privately held companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages.\nWe record marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily\ndeterminable market values, of which publicly traded stocks and mutual funds are subject to market price volatility, and\nrepresent $6.0 billion and $5.1 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. A\nhypothetical adverse price change of 10% on our December 31, 2024 balance would decrease the fair value of\nmarketable equity securities by $508 million. From time to time, we may enter into derivatives to hedge the market\nprice risk on certain of our marketable equity securities.\nOur non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are primarily adjusted to fair\nvalue for observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as\nthe measurement alternative). The fair value measured at the time of the observable transaction is not necessarily an\nindication of the current fair value as of the balance sheet date. These investments, especially those that are in the\nearly stages, are inherently risky because the technologies or products these companies have under development are\ntypically in the early phases and may never materialize, and they may experience a decline in financial condition,\nwhich could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. Valuations of our equity\ninvestments in private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data and\n46.",

        "text": "Financial filing text section: Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\nNon-marketable securities that do not have effective contractual maturity dates are classified as other non-\ncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nSee Note 3 for the accounting policy pertaining to derivative financial instruments.\nAccounts Receivable\nOur payment terms for accounts receivable vary by the types and locations of our customers and the products or\nservices offered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or\nservices and customers, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer.\nAdditionally, accounts receivable includes amounts for services performed in advance of the right to invoice the\ncustomer.\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable, which is recorded as an offset to accounts\nreceivable, and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements\nof Income. We assess collectibility by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics\nexist and on an individual basis when we identify specific customers with known disputes or collectibility issues. In\ndetermining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we consider historical collectibility based on past due status\nand make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also consider\ncustomer-specific information, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic\nconditions.\nConvertible Notes\nOur investments in convertible notes are primarily recorded at amortized cost which includes unpaid principal\nbalances, deferred origination costs, and any related discount or premium, net of allowances for credit losses, and are\nincluded within other non-current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOther\nOur financial instruments also include debt and equity investments in companies with which we also entered into\ncommercial arrangements at or near the same time. For these transactions, judgment is required in assessing the\nsubstance of the arrangements, including assessing whether the components of the arrangements should be\naccounted for as separate transactions under the applicable GAAP, and determining the value of the components of\nthe arrangements, including the fair value of the investments. Additionally, if our investment in such companies\nbecomes impaired, we may need to re-evaluate the accounting for the commercial arrangement, including reducing\nany remaining performance obligations.\nImpairment of Investments\nWe periodically review our debt and non-marketable equity securities for impairment.\nFor debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists. The credit loss is\nestimated by considering available information relevant to the collectibility of the security and information about past\nevents, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Any credit loss is recorded as a charge to OI&E,\nnot to exceed the amount of the unrealized loss. Unrealized losses other than the credit loss are recognized in AOCI. If\nwe have an intent to sell, or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a debt security in an unrealized\nloss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis, we will write down the security to its fair value and record the\ncorresponding charge as a component of OI&E.\nFor non-marketable equity securities, including equity method investments, we consider whether impairment\nindicators exist by evaluating the companies' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among\nother indicators. If the assessment indicates that the investment is impaired, we write down the investment to its fair\nvalue by recording the corresponding charge as a component of OI&E. We prepare quantitative measurements of the\nfair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income approach.\nInventory\nInventory consists primarily of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is\ncomputed using the first-in, first-out method.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in\nwhich we have other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity (VIE). We consolidate VIEs when we are\n61.",

We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have the power to direct activities that most\nsignificantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses\nor benefits. If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a\nVIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.\nPeriodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination\nof whether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is comprised of technical infrastructure, office space, corporate and other assets\ncurrently in service, and assets not yet in service. Technical infrastructure includes data center land, buildings and\nleasehold improvements, and servers and network equipment. Office space includes office land, buildings and\nleasehold improvements. Assets not yet in service are those that are not ready for our intended use, including data\ncenter buildings and servers in the process of construction or assembly.\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation commences once assets\nare ready for our intended use and is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the\nassets, which we regularly evaluate for factors such as technological obsolescence and our planned use and\nutilization. We depreciate data center and office buildings over periods of seven to 40 years. We depreciate servers\nand network equipment generally over a period of six years. We depreciate corporate and other assets over periods of\ntwo to 25 years. We depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated\nuseful lives of the assets. Land is not depreciated.\nGoodwill\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. We\nevaluate our reporting units periodically, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in\nreporting units, we reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. We test our goodwill for\nimpairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be\nimpaired. Goodwill impairments were not material for the periods presented.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-\nlease components. Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed. Non-lease components primarily\ninclude payments for maintenance and utilities. We combine fixed payments for non-lease components with lease\npayments and account for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets\nand liabilities.\nCertain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the\nlease assets and liabilities. These amounts primarily include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index, and\npayments for maintenance and utilities.\nLease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease\ncommencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our\nincremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable. Our incremental\nborrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments,\nand in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Our lease terms include periods under options to\nextend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally use the\nbase, non-cancelable, lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. Lease assets also include any\nprepaid lease payments and lease incentives.\nLease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The current portion of our\noperating lease liabilities is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and the long-term portion is\nincluded in operating lease liabilities. Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment, net. Finance lease\nliabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or other long-term liabilities.\nOperating lease expense (excluding variable lease costs) is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease\nterm. Finance lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life\nof the asset, and interest expense is recognized based on the incremental borrowing rate.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review leases, property and equipment, and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment when\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed\n62.",

The results of\noperations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.\nFor certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us, and their creditors do not have recourse to us.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2024, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $4.9 billion\nand $8.7 billion, respectively and are primarily included in cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance\nSheets. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs were $2.5\nbillion and $2.3 billion, respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs that are included\nwithin Other Bets.\nWaymo, a fully autonomous driving technology company and a consolidated VIE, received $5.6 billion in funding\nduring the year ended December 31, 2024, the majority of which was funded by Alphabet. Investments from external\nparties were accounted for as equity transactions and resulted in recognition of noncontrolling interests.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2024, total noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were\n$3.4 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, of which $1.1 billion was redeemable noncontrolling interests (RNCI) for both\nperiods. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests\nwas not material for any period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of OI&E. See Note 7 for further\ndetails on OI&E.\nUnconsolidated VIEs\nWe have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private companies\nthat are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve power\ngeneration using renewable sources.\nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that\nwould significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results of\noperations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We account\nfor these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments, which are included\nwithin non-marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The maximum exposure of these\nunconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the investments and any future funding\ncommitments. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, our future funding commitments related to unconsolidated VIE\ninvestments were $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively.\nNote 6. Debt\nShort-Term Debt\nWe have a debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds\nfrom this program are used for general corporate purposes.

Variable Interest Entities (VIE)\nConsolidated VIEs\nWe consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of\noperations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.\nFor certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us and their creditors do not have recourse to\nus. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs\nwere $4.1 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs\nwere $2.6 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs that are\nincluded within Other Bets.\nTotal noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were $3.8 billion and $3.7 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023, respectively, of which $1.1 billion is redeemable noncontrolling interest\n(RNCI) for both periods. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to\nnoncontrolling interests was not material for any period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of\nOI&E. See Note 6 for further details on OI&E.\nUnconsolidated VIEs\nWe have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private\ncompanies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve\npower generation using renewable sources.\nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that\nwould significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results\nof operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We\naccount for these investments as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments.\nThe maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the\ninvestments and any future funding commitments. We have determined that the single source of our exposure to\nthese VIEs is our capital investments in them. The carrying value and maximum exposure of these unconsolidated\nVIEs were $2.7 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2022 and $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion,\nrespectively, as of March 31, 2023.\nNote 5. Debt\nShort-Term Debt\nWe have a debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net\nproceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as\nof December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023.\nOur short-term debt balance also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt.\n19",

We have\nagreed to defend and/or hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or\ncovenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these\nagreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In\naddition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain\nsimilar indemnification obligations to our agents.\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification\nagreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the\npayments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the\nfuture, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations or cash flows in a particular period.\nAs of March 31, 2023, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably\npossible.\n24",

Variable Interest Entities (VIE)\nConsolidated VIEs\nWe consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of\noperations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.\nFor certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us, and their creditors do not have recourse to\nus. As of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs\nwere $4.9 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs\nwere $2.5 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs that are\nincluded within Other Bets.\nTotal noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were $3.4 billion and $3.2 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively, of which $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion is redeemable\nnoncontrolling interest (RNCI) as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively. NCI and RNCI are\nincluded within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was not material for any\nperiod presented and is included within the \"other\" component of OI&E. See Note 6 for further details on OI&E.\nUnconsolidated VIEs\nWe have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private\ncompanies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve\npower generation using renewable sources.\nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that\nwould significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results\nof operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We\naccount for these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments.\nThe maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the\ninvestments and any future funding commitments. The maximum exposure and carrying value of these\nunconsolidated VIEs were $5.7 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2023 and $6.9 billion and\n$5.3 billion, respectively, as of March 31, 2024. The difference between the maximum exposure and the carrying\nvalue relates primarily to future funding commitments.\nNote 5. Debt\nShort-Term Debt\nWe have a debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net\nproceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as\nof December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024.\nOur short-term debt balance also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt.\n19",

        "text": "Financial filing text section: Note 5. Variable Interest Entities\nConsolidated VIEs\nWe consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of\noperations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.\nFor certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us, and their creditors do not have recourse to\nus. As of December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs\nwere $8.7 billion and $7.8 billion, respectively, and are primarily included in cash and cash equivalents on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, liabilities for which creditors only\nhave recourse to the VIEs were $2.3 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing\noperations of certain VIEs that are included within Other Bets.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, total noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated\nsubsidiaries were $4.2 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively, of which $1.1 billion was redeemable noncontrolling\ninterests (RNCI) in each period. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to\nnoncontrolling interests was not material for any period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of\nOI&E. See Note 7 for further details on OI&E.\nUnconsolidated VIEs\nWe have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private\ncompanies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve\npower generation using renewable sources.\nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that\nwould significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results\nof operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We\naccount for these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments, which\nare included within non-marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The maximum exposure of\nthese unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the investments and any future\nfunding commitments. As of December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, our future funding commitments related to\nunconsolidated VIE investments were $1.5 billion in each period.\nNote 6. Debt\nShort-Term Debt\nWe have a short-term debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper.\nNet proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion of\ncommercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, respectively, with a weighted-average\neffective interest rate of 4.4% in each period. The estimated fair value of the commercial paper approximated its\ncarrying value as of March 31, 2025.\nOur short-term debt balance also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt.\n21",

Variable Interest Entities (VIE)\nConsolidated VIEs\nWe consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of\noperations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.\nFor certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us and their creditors do not have recourse to\nus. As of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2022, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs\nwere $6.0 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs\nwere $2.5 billion for both periods.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2022, total noncontrolling interests (NCI), including redeemable\nnoncontrolling interests (RNCI), in our consolidated subsidiaries was $4.3 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively. NCI\nand RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was not\nmaterial for any period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of other income (expense), net. See\nNote 6 for further details on other income (expense), net.\nUnconsolidated VIEs\nWe have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private\ncompanies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve\npower generation using renewable sources.\nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that\nwould significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results\nof operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We\naccount for these investments as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments.\nThe maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the\ninvestments and any future funding commitments. We have determined that the single source of our exposure to\nthese VIEs is our capital investments in them. The carrying value and maximum exposure of these unconsolidated\nVIEs were $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2021 and $2.4 billion and $2.4 billion,\nrespectively, as of June 30, 2022.\nNote 5. Debt\nShort-Term Debt\nWe have a debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net\nproceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as\nof December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2022.\nOur short-term debt balance also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt.\nLong-Term Debt\nTotal outstanding debt is summarized below (in millions, except percentages):\nAs of\nEffective Interest December 31, As of\nMaturity Coupon Rate Rate 2021 June 30, 2022\nDebt\n2014-2020 Notes Issuances 2024 - 2060 0.45% - 3.38% 0.57% - 3.38% $ 13,000 $ 13,000\nFuture finance lease payments, net\nand other (1) 2,086 1,966\nTotal debt 15,086 14,966\nUnamortized discount and debt\nissuance costs (156) (150)\nLess: Current portion future finance\nlease payments, net and other\ncurrent debt(1)(2) (113) (82)\nTotal long-term debt $ 14,817 $ 14,734\n(1) Future finance lease payments are net of imputed interest.\n(2) Total current portion of long-term debt is included within other accrued expenses and current liabilities.

Variable Interest Entities (VIE)\nConsolidated VIEs\nWe consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of\noperations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.\nFor certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us and their creditors do not have recourse to\nus. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs\nwere $4.1 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs\nwere $2.6 billion for both periods. We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs that are included\nwithin Other Bets.\nTotal noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were $3.8 billion and $3.6 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023, respectively, of which $1.1 billion is redeemable noncontrolling interest\n(RNCI) for both periods. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to\nnoncontrolling interests was not material for any period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of\nOI&E. See Note 6 for further details on OI&E.\nUnconsolidated VIEs\nWe have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private\ncompanies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve\npower generation using renewable sources.\nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that\nwould significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results\nof operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We\naccount for these investments as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments.\nThe maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the\ninvestments and any future funding commitments. We have determined that the single source of our exposure to\nthese VIEs is our capital investments in them. The carrying value and maximum exposure of these unconsolidated\nVIEs were $2.7 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2022 and $3.0 billion and $3.0 billion,\nrespectively, as of June 30, 2023.\nNote 5. Debt\nShort-Term Debt\nWe have a debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net\nproceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as\nof December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023.\nOur short-term debt balance also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt.\n21",

We have\nagreed to defend and/or hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or\ncovenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these\nagreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In\naddition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain\nsimilar indemnification obligations to our agents.\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification\nagreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the\npayments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the\nfuture, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations or cash flows in a particular period.\nAs of June 30, 2023, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably\npossible.\n26",

Variable Interest Entities (VIE)\nConsolidated VIEs\nWe consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of\noperations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.\nFor certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us, and their creditors do not have recourse to\nus. As of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2024, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs\nwere $4.9 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs\nwere $2.5 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs that are\nincluded within Other Bets.\nIn July 2024, Alphabet committed to fund up to $5.0 billion for the ongoing operations of Waymo, a fully\nautonomous driving technology company and a consolidated VIE.\nTotal noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were $3.4 billion and $3.3 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and June 30, 2024, respectively, of which $1.1 billion is redeemable noncontrolling interest\n(RNCI) for both periods. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to\nnoncontrolling interests was not material for any period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of\nOI&E. See Note 6 for further details on OI&E.\nUnconsolidated VIEs\nWe have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private\ncompanies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve\npower generation using renewable sources.\nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that\nwould significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results\nof operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We\naccount for these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments.\nThe maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the\ninvestments and any future funding commitments. The maximum exposure and carrying value of these\nunconsolidated VIEs were $5.7 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2023 and $6.9 billion and\n$5.4 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2024. The difference between the maximum exposure and the carrying\nvalue relates primarily to future funding commitments.\nNote 5. Debt\nShort-Term Debt\nWe have a debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net\nproceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as\nof December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2024.\nOur short-term debt balance also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt.\n21",

        "text": "Financial filing text section: Note 5. Variable Interest Entities\nConsolidated VIEs\nWe consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of\noperations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.\nFor certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us, and their creditors do not have recourse to\nus. As of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs\nwere $8.7 billion and $7.0 billion, respectively, and are primarily included in cash and cash equivalents on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025, liabilities for which creditors only have\nrecourse to the VIEs were $2.3 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing operations of\ncertain VIEs that are included within Other Bets.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025, total noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated\nsubsidiaries were $4.2 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, of which $1.1 billion was redeemable noncontrolling\ninterests (RNCI) in each period. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to\nnoncontrolling interests was not material for any period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of\nOI&E. See Note 7 for further details on OI&E.\nUnconsolidated VIEs\nWe have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private\ncompanies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve\npower generation using renewable sources.\nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that\nwould significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results\nof operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We\naccount for these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments, which\nare included within non-marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The maximum exposure of\nthese unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the investments and any future\nfunding commitments. As of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025, our future funding commitments related to\nunconsolidated VIE investments were $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.\nNote 6. Debt\nShort-Term Debt\nWe have a short-term debt financing program of up to $25.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper.\nNet proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had $2.3 billion and $3.0 billion of\ncommercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025, respectively, with a weighted-average\neffective interest rate of 4.4% in each period. The estimated fair value of the commercial paper approximated its\ncarrying value as of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025.\nOur short-term debt balance also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt.\nLong-Term Debt\nIn May 2025, we issued $5.0 billion of U.S. dollar-denominated fixed-rate senior unsecured notes in four\ntranches: $750 million of 4.00% notes due 2030, $1.25 billion of 4.50% notes due 2035, $1.5 billion of 5.25% notes\ndue 2055, and $1.5 billion of 5.30% notes due 2065. Additionally in May 2025, we issued \u20ac6.75 billion of euro-\ndenominated fixed-rate senior unsecured notes in five tranches: \u20ac1.5 billion of 2.50% notes due 2029, \u20ac1.5 billion of\n3.00% notes due 2033, \u20ac1.25 billion of 3.38% notes due 2037, \u20ac1.25 billion of 3.88% notes due 2045, and\n\u20ac1.25 billion of 4.00% notes due 2054. The net proceeds from all notes issued in May 2025 are used for general\ncorporate purposes.\n24",

Variable Interest Entities (VIE)\nConsolidated VIEs\nWe consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of\noperations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.\nFor certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us and their creditors do not have recourse to\nus. As of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these\nVIEs were $6.0 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the\nVIEs were $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, total noncontrolling interests (NCI), including redeemable\nnoncontrolling interests (RNCI), in our consolidated subsidiaries were $4.3 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively. NCI\nand RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was not\nmaterial for any period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of other income (expense), net. See\nNote 6 for further details on other income (expense), net.\nUnconsolidated VIEs\nWe have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private\ncompanies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve\npower generation using renewable sources.\nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that\nwould significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results\nof operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We\naccount for these investments as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments.\nThe maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the\ninvestments and any future funding commitments. We have determined that the single source of our exposure to\nthese VIEs is our capital investments in them. The carrying value and maximum exposure of these unconsolidated\nVIEs were $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2021 and $2.6 billion and $2.6 billion,\nrespectively, as of September 30, 2022.\nNote 5. Debt\nShort-Term Debt\nWe have a debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net\nproceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as\nof December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022.\nOur short-term debt balance also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt.\nLong-Term Debt\nTotal outstanding debt is summarized below (in millions, except percentages):\nAs of As of\nEffective Interest December 31, September 30,\nMaturity Coupon Rate Rate 2021 2022\nDebt\n2014-2020 Notes Issuances 2024 - 2060 0.45% - 3.38% 0.57% - 3.38% $ 13,000 $ 13,000\nFuture finance lease payments, net\nand other (1) 2,086 2,213\nTotal debt 15,086 15,213\nUnamortized discount and debt\nissuance costs (156) (146)\nLess: Current portion future finance\nlease payments, net and other\ncurrent debt(1)(2) (113) (414)\nTotal long-term debt $ 14,817 $ 14,653\n(1) Future finance lease payments are net of imputed interest.\n(2) Total current portion of long-term debt is included within other accrued expenses and current liabilities.

Variable Interest Entities (VIE)\nConsolidated VIEs\nWe consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of\noperations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.\nFor certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us and their creditors do not have recourse to\nus. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these\nVIEs were $4.1 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the\nVIEs were $2.6 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs\nthat are included within Other Bets.\nTotal noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were $3.8 billion and $3.4 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023, respectively, of which $1.1 billion is redeemable noncontrolling\ninterest (RNCI) for both periods. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to\nnoncontrolling interests was not material for any period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of\nOI&E. See Note 6 for further details on OI&E.\nUnconsolidated VIEs\nWe have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private\ncompanies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve\npower generation using renewable sources.\nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that\nwould significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results\nof operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We\naccount for these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments.\nThe maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the\ninvestments and any future funding commitments. The maximum exposure and carrying value of these\nunconsolidated VIEs were $2.8 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2022 and $5.5 billion and\n$3.8 billion, respectively, as of September 30, 2023. The difference between the maximum exposure and the\ncarrying value relates primarily to future funding commitments.\nNote 5. Debt\nShort-Term Debt\nWe have a debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net\nproceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as\nof December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023.\nOur short-term debt balance also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt.\n21",

We have\nagreed to defend and/or hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or\ncovenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these\nagreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In\naddition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain\nsimilar indemnification obligations to our agents.\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification\nagreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the\npayments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the\nfuture, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations or cash flows in a particular period.\nAs of September 30, 2023, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or\nreasonably possible.\n26",

        "text": "Financial filing text section: Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\nEquity Securities Accounted for Under the Equity Method\nAs of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, equity securities accounted for under the equity method\nhad a carrying value of approximately $1.7 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. Our share of gains and losses,\nincluding impairments, are included as a component of OI&E, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note\n6 for further details on OI&E. Certain of our equity method securities include our investments in VIEs where we are\nnot the primary beneficiary. See Note 4 for further details on VIEs.\nConvertible Notes\nAs of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, we had investments in convertible notes of $921 million\nand $2.8 billion, respectively, majority of which are convertible notes held for investment. Our convertible notes held\nfor investment are recorded at amortized cost which includes unpaid principal balances, deferred origination costs,\nand any related discount or premium, net of allowances for credit losses, and are included within other non-current\nassets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe use derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk\nmanaged is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows,\nearnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate\nfluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance\ninvestment returns.\nWe recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the\nderivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy\ncomprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at\ngross fair values. The accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation.\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge\ncertain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States (U.S.) dollar. These\ncontracts have maturities of 24 months or less.\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and\nsubsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points\nand time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life\nof the hedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and\nthe amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the net accumulated loss on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax\neffect was $433 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.\nFair Value Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our\nmarketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in\nthe assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OI&E, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the\nrelated hedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize\nchanges in the excluded component in OI&E.\nNet Investment Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks\nrelated to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of\nhedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude\nforward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in\nOI&E.\nOther Derivatives\nWe enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to\nhedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the\nfunctional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting\nhedges are primarily recorded in OI&E along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and\nliabilities.\n17",

We\nmay redeem the notes at any time in whole or in part at specified redemption prices. The effective interest rates are\nbased on proceeds received with interest payable semi-annually.\nThe total estimated fair value of the outstanding notes was approximately $10.3 billion and $9.5 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, respectively. The fair value was determined based on observable\nmarket prices of identical instruments in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as Level 2 in the fair\nvalue hierarchy.\nCredit Facility\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, of which $4.0 billion expires in April\n2025 and $6.0 billion expires in April 2028. The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a\nformula using certain market rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals.\nNo amounts were outstanding under the credit facilities as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024.\nNote 6. Supplemental Financial Statement Information\nAccounts Receivable\nThe allowance for credit losses on accounts receivable was $771 million and $857 million as of December 31,\n2023 and September 30, 2024, respectively.",

Business Combinations\ncharacter.ai\nIn accordance with the accounting requirements under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805, during\nthe three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded $2.7 billion of goodwill and $413 million of intangible\nassets resulting from a transaction with character.ai (\u201cCharacter\u201d). In August 2024, we entered into a license\nagreement with Character pursuant to which we obtained a non-exclusive license to its current large language\nmodel technology. We paid Character $2.7 billion in cash and canceled our convertible instruments. We also hired\ncertain employees of Character. Goodwill was recorded in Google Services and Google Cloud and is deductible for\ntax purposes.\nNote 8. Goodwill\nGoodwill\nChanges in the carrying amount of goodwill for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were as follows (in\nmillions):\nGoogle\nServices Google Cloud Other Bets Total\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 $ 21,118 $ 7,199 $ 881 $ 29,198\nAdditions 2,438 292 0 2,730\nForeign currency translation and other adjustments 7 1 (1) 7\nBalance as of September 30, 2024 $ 23,563 $ 7,492 $ 880 $ 31,935\nNote 9. Commitments and Contingencies\nCommitments\nWe have content licensing agreements with future fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments of $9.2 billion as\nof September 30, 2024, of which the majority is paid quarterly through the first quarter of 2030.\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate\nactivities, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network partners, distribution partners,\ncustomers of Google Cloud offerings, lessors, and service providers with respect to certain matters. We have\nagreed to defend and/or hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or\ncovenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these\nagreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In\naddition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain\nsimilar indemnification obligations to our agents.\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification\nagreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the\npayments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the\nfuture, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations or cash flows in a particular period.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or\nreasonably possible.\nLegal Matters\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be\nreasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be\nestimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could\naffect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible\nlosses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.\nCertain outstanding matters seek speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts, substantial\nchanges to our business practices and products, or structural remedies. Significant judgment is required to\ndetermine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and\nwe may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses.
