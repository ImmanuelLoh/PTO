We believe\nthe presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to\nunderstand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of\nour core operating results.\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant\nperiod over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency\nexchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated\nlevel. We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a\nyear-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior\nyear comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.\nConstant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period\nrevenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are\ntranslated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of\nboth periods.\nThese results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with\nGAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled\nmeasures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table presents the foreign currency exchange effect on international revenues and total revenues\n(in millions, except percentages):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2024\n% Change from Prior Period\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, Constant Less Constant\nLess FX Currency As Hedging Less FX Currency\n2023 2024 Effect Revenues Reported Effect Effect Revenues\nUnited States $ 32,864 $ 38,737 $ 0 $ 38,737 18 % 0 % 18 %\nEMEA 21,078 23,788 204 23,584 13 % 1 % 12 %\nAPAC 11,681 13,289 (439) 13,728 14 % (4) % 18 %\nOther Americas 4,080 4,653 (152) 4,805 14 % (4) % 18 %\nRevenues, excluding hedging\neffect 69,703 80,467 (387) 80,854 15 % (1) % 16 %\nHedging gains (losses) 84 72\nTotal revenues(1) $ 69,787 $ 80,539 $ 80,854 15 % 0 % (1) % 16 %\n(1) Total constant currency revenues of $80.9 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased $11.2 billion\ncompared to $69.7 billion in revenues, excluding hedging effect, for the three months ended March 31, 2023.\nEMEA revenue growth was favorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to\nthe U.S. dollar weakening relative to the Euro, partially offset by the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Turkish\nlira.\nAPAC revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due\nto the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Japanese yen.\nOther Americas revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates,\nprimarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Argentine peso.\n35",

We expect that this evolution will continue to benefit our business and our revenues, although at a slower\npace than we have experienced historically. In addition, we face increasing competition for user engagement and\nadvertisers, including from other developers and providers of AI products and services, which may affect our revenues.\n\u2022 Users continue to access our products and services using diverse devices and modalities, which\nallows for new advertising formats that may benefit our revenues but adversely affect our margins.\nOur users are accessing our products and services via diverse devices and modalities beyond traditional desktop,\nsuch as smartphones, wearables, connected TVs, and smart home devices, and want to be able to be connected no\nmatter where they are or what they are doing. We are focused on expanding our products and services to stay in front\nof these trends in order to maintain and grow our business.\nWe benefit from advertising revenues generated from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising\nformats. The margins from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional\ndesktop search. Additionally, as the market for a particular device type or modality matures, our advertising revenues\nmay be affected. For example, changing dynamics within the global smartphone market, such as increased market\nsaturation in developed countries, can affect our mobile advertising revenues.\nWe expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our revenues grow\nand TAC as a percentage of our advertising revenues (\"TAC rate\") to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic\nmix; partner agreement terms; partner mix; the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points; product\nmix; the relative revenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels; and revenue share terms.\nWe expect these trends to continue to affect our revenues and put pressure on our margins.\n\u2022 As online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings, which may affect our\nmonetization.\nAs interactions between users and advertisers change, and as online user behavior evolves, for example with AI,\nwe continue to expand our product offerings to serve these changing needs, which may affect monetization of our\nproducts and services. We expect to continue to incorporate AI innovations into our products, such as AI in Search,\nthat could affect our monetization trends. When developing new products and services we generally focus first on user\nexperience and then on monetization.\n\u2022 As users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets\ncontinue to increase, and may require continued investments. In addition, movements in foreign exchange\nrates affect such revenues.\nThe shift to online, as well as the advent of the multi-device world, has brought opportunities outside of the U.S.,\nincluding in emerging markets, such as India. We continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our\nproducts and advertising programs relevant to our users in these markets. This has led to a trend of increased\n30.",
