We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP\npercentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for\nfinancial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe\nthe presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to\nunderstand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of\nour core operating results.\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant\nperiod over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency\nexchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated\nlevel. We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a\nyear-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior\nyear comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.\nConstant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period\nrevenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are\ntranslated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of\nboth periods.\nThese results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with\nGAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled\nmeasures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table presents the foreign currency exchange effect on international revenues and total revenues\n(in millions, except percentages):\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2024\n% Change from Prior Period\nThree Months Ended\nJune 30, Constant Less Constant\nLess FX Currency As Hedging Less FX Currency\n2023 2024 Effect Revenues Reported Effect Effect Revenues\nUnited States $ 35,073 $ 41,196 $ 0 $ 41,196 17 % 0 % 17 %\nEMEA 22,289 24,683 (367) 25,050 11 % (1) % 12 %\nAPAC 12,728 13,823 (595) 14,418 9 % (4) % 13 %\nOther Americas 4,511 4,938 (305) 5,243 9 % (7) % 16 %\nRevenues, excluding hedging\neffect 74,601 84,640 (1,267) 85,907 13 % (2) % 15 %\nHedging gains (losses) 3 102\nTotal revenues(1) $ 74,604 $ 84,742 $ 85,907 14 % 1 % (2) % 15 %\n(1) Total constant currency revenues of $85.9 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2024 increased $11.3 billion\ncompared to $74.6 billion in revenues, excluding hedging effect, for the three months ended June 30, 2023.\nEMEA revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due\nto the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Turkish lira.\nAPAC revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due\nto the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Japanese yen.\nOther Americas revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates,\nprimarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Argentine peso.\n39",
