In Google Services, we also generate cash through\nconsumer subscriptions and the sale of apps and in-app purchases and devices. In Google Cloud we generate cash\nthrough consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, collaboration tools, and other cloud\nservices.\nOur primary uses of cash from operating activities include payments to distribution and Google Network partners,\nto employees for compensation, and to content providers. Other uses of cash from operating activities include\npayments to suppliers for devices, to tax authorities for income taxes, and other general corporate expenditures.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased from 2022 to 2023 due to the increase in cash received from\ncustomers, partially offset by increases in cash paid for cost of revenues and operating expenses.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nCash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of investments in marketable and\nnon-marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of marketable and non-\nmarketable securities, purchases of property and equipment, and payments for acquisitions.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased from 2022 to 2023 due to a decrease in maturities and sales of\nmarketable securities, partially offset by a decrease in payments for acquisitions.\nCash Used in Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from the\nsale of interests in consolidated entities. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of stock,\nnet payments related to stock-based award activities, and repayments of debt.\nNet cash used in financing activities increased from 2022 to 2023 due to an increase in repurchases of stock.\nLiquidity and Material Cash Requirements\nWe expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, cash flows from operations and\nfinancing activities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and\nfinancing activities for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\nCapital Expenditures and Leases\nWe make investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology assets\nthrough purchases of property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our\nservices and products.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories:\n\u2022 technical infrastructure, which consists of our investments in servers and network equipment for computing,\nstorage, and networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including AI, (collectively referred to as\nour information technology assets) and data center land and building construction; and\n\u2022 office facilities, ground-up development projects, and building improvements (also referred to as \"fit-outs\").\nConstruction in progress consists primarily of technical infrastructure and office facilities which have not yet been\nplaced in service. The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend from\nmonths to years. For example, our data center construction projects are generally multi-year projects with multiple\nphases, where we acquire land and buildings, construct buildings, and secure and install information technology\nassets.\n41.",

We expect to increase, relative to 2023, our investment in our technical infrastructure,\nincluding servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term\ninitiatives, in particular in support of AI products and services. Depreciation of our property and equipment commences\nwhen the deployment of such assets are completed and are ready for our intended use. Land is not depreciated. For\nthe years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, our depreciation on property and equipment were $13.5 billion and\n$11.9 billion, respectively.\nLeases\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, we recognized total operating lease assets of $4.4 billion and\n$2.9 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the amount of total future lease payments under operating leases,\nwhich had a weighted average remaining lease term of eight years, was $17.7 billion, of which $3.2 billion is short-\nterm. As of December 31, 2023, we have entered into leases that have not yet commenced with future short-term and\nlong-term lease payments of $657 million and $3.3 billion, that are not yet recorded on our Consolidated Balance\nSheets. These leases will commence between 2024 and 2026 with non-cancelable lease terms of one to 25 years.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, our operating lease expenses (including variable lease costs)\nwere $3.7 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively. Finance lease costs were not material for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2023. For additional information, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFinancing\nWe have a short-term debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net\nproceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2023, we had no\ncommercial paper outstanding.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, $4.0 billion expiring in April 2024 and\n$6.0 billion expiring in April 2028. The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using\ncertain market rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals. No amounts have\nbeen borrowed under the credit facilities.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with a total carrying value of $12.9 billion\nwith short-term and long-term future interest payments of $214 million and $3.6 billion, respectively. For additional\ninformation, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K.\nWe primarily utilize contract manufacturers for the assembly of our servers used in our technical infrastructure\nand devices we sell. We have agreements where we may purchase components directly from suppliers and then\nsupply these components to contract manufacturers for use in the assembly of the servers and devices. Certain of\nthese arrangements result in a portion of the cash received from and paid to the contract manufacturers to be\npresented as financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in Item 8 of this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.\nShare Repurchase Program\nDuring 2023 we repurchased and subsequently retired 528 million shares for $62.2 billion.\nIn April 2023, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $70.0\nbillion of its Class A and Class C shares. As of December 31, 2023, $36.3 billion remains available for Class A and\nClass C share repurchases.\nThe following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 Year Ended December 31, 2023\nShares Amount Shares Amount\nClass A share repurchases 61 $ 6,719 78 $ 9,316\nClass C share repurchases 469 52,577 450 52,868\nTotal share repurchases(1) 530 $ 59,296 528 $ 62,184\n(1) Shares repurchased include unsettled repurchases as of December 31, 2023.\nFor additional information, see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n42.",

Where applicable,\nthese models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based\nobservable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities.\nThe fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of\nunobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The determination of fair value involves the use of appropriate\nvaluation methods and relevant inputs into valuation models.\nOur financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents,\nmarketable securities, derivative financial instruments, and certain non-marketable debt securities. Our financial assets\nmeasured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include non-marketable equity securities. Other financial assets and\nliabilities are carried at cost with fair value disclosed, if required.\nWe measure certain other instruments, including SBC awards settled in the stock of Other Bet companies, and\ncertain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, also at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.\nFinancial Instruments\nOur financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents, marketable and non-marketable securities, derivative\nfinancial instruments and accounts receivable.\nCredit Risks\nWe are subject to credit risk primarily from cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, derivative financial\ninstruments, including foreign exchange contracts, and accounts receivable. We manage our credit risk exposure\nthrough timely assessment of our counterparty creditworthiness, credit limits and use of collateral management.\nForeign exchange contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing. Accounts\nreceivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the world.\nWe manage our credit risk exposure by performing ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the\namount of credit we extend. We generally do not require collateral from our customers.\nCash Equivalents\nWe invest excess cash primarily in government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-\nbacked securities, time deposits, and money market funds.\nMarketable Securities\nWe classify all marketable debt securities that have effective maturities of three months or less from the date of\npurchase as cash equivalents and those with effective maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities\non our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable\ndebt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. We have\nclassified and accounted for our marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. After consideration of our risk versus\nreward objectives, as well as our liquidity requirements, we may sell these debt securities prior to their effective\nmaturities. As we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify highly liquid securities\nwith maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets. We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a\ncomponent of stockholders\u2019 equity, except for the changes in allowance for expected credit losses, which are recorded\nin OI&E. For certain marketable debt securities we have elected the fair value option, for which changes in fair value\nare recorded in OI&E. We determine any realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable debt securities on a\nspecific identification method, and we record such gains and losses as a component of OI&E.\nOur investments in marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with the related gains and losses,\nincluding unrealized, recognized in OI&E. We classify our marketable equity securities subject to long-term lock-up\nrestrictions beyond 12 months as other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNon-Marketable Securities\nNon-marketable securities primarily consist of equity securities. We account for non-marketable equity securities\nthrough which we exercise significant influence but do not have control over the investee under the equity method. All\nother non-marketable equity securities that we hold are primarily accounted for under the measurement alternative.\nUnder the measurement alternative, the carrying value is measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus\n59.",

It is more likely than not that the\nmajority of the net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized; therefore, we have recorded a valuation allowance\nagainst them. The net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various annual limitations under the tax laws of the\ndifferent jurisdictions.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our Federal and California research and development credit carryforwards for income\ntax purposes were approximately $600 million and $6.3 billion, respectively. If not utilized, the Federal R&D credit will\nbegin to expire in 2037 and the California R&D credit can be carried over indefinitely. We believe the majority of the\nfederal tax credit and state tax credit is not likely to be realized.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our investment tax credit carryforwards for state income tax purposes were\napproximately $1.0 billion and will begin to expire in 2029. We use the flow-through method of accounting for\ninvestment tax credits. We believe this tax credit is not likely to be realized.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we maintained a valuation allowance with respect to California deferred tax assets,\ncertain federal net operating losses, certain state net operating losses and tax credits, net deferred tax assets relating\nto Other Bet companies, and certain foreign net operating losses that we believe are not likely to be realized. We\ncontinue to reassess the remaining valuation allowance quarterly, and if future evidence allows for a partial or full\nrelease of the valuation allowance, a tax benefit will be recorded accordingly.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to our gross unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021 2022 2023\nBeginning gross unrecognized tax benefits $ 3,837 $ 5,158 $ 7,055\nIncreases related to prior year tax positions 529 253 740\nDecreases related to prior year tax positions (263) (437) (682)\nDecreases related to settlement with tax authorities (329) (140) (21)\nIncreases related to current year tax positions 1,384 2,221 2,346\nEnding gross unrecognized tax benefits $ 5,158 $ 7,055 $ 9,438\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating\nour uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. The total amount of gross unrecognized tax\nbenefits was $5.2 billion, $7.1 billion, and $9.4 billion as of December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively, of which\n$3.7 billion, $5.3 billion, and $7.4 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2023, we accrued $346 million and $622 million in interest and penalties in\nprovision for income taxes, respectively.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. Our two\nmajor tax jurisdictions are the U.S. federal and Ireland. We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax\nreturns by the IRS and other tax authorities. The IRS is currently examining our 2016 through 2021 tax returns. We\nhave also received tax assessments in multiple foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or\npermanent establishment. We continue to defend such claims as presented.\nThe tax years 2016 through 2022 remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for\nIrish tax purposes. There are other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial\nstatements.\nWe regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the\nadequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax\nauthorities and the effect, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions.\nWe believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.\nHowever, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are\nresolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for\nincome taxes in the period such resolutions occur. Although the timing of resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is\nnot certain, it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits from certain U.S. federal, state, and non U.S.\ntax positions could decrease by approximately $700 million in the next 12 months. Positions that may be resolved\ninclude various U.S. and non-U.S. matters.\n85.",

Alphabet\u2019s investment in the portfolio of Other Bets includes businesses\nthat are at various stages of development, ranging from those in the R&D phase to those that are in the beginning\nstages of commercialization. Our goal is for them to become thriving, successful businesses. Other Bets operate as\nindependent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent members and outside investors.\nWhile these early-stage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty, some of them are already generating\nrevenue and making important strides in their industries. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the\nsale of healthcare-related services, and internet services.\nCompetition\nOur business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptive technologies.

For example, for advertising, competing successfully depends\non attracting and retaining:\n\u2022 users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance\nof our advertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and availability of our products and services;\n\u2022 advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver\ntheir advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels; and\n\u2022 content providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners\ngenerate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\n8.",

As of December 31, 2024, we have entered into leases that have not yet commenced with\nfuture short-term and long-term lease payments of $773 million and $6.5 billion, respectively, that are not yet recorded\non our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These leases will commence between 2025 and 2028 with non-cancelable lease\nterms of one to 25 years.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024, our operating lease expenses (including variable lease costs)\nwere $4.5 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively.

Other financial assets and\nliabilities are carried at cost with fair value disclosed, if required.\nWe measure certain other instruments, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, also\nat fair value on a nonrecurring basis.\nFinancial Instruments\nOur financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents, marketable and non-marketable securities, derivative\nfinancial instruments, accounts receivable, and convertible notes.\nCredit Risks\nWe are subject to credit risk primarily from cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, derivative financial\ninstruments, including foreign exchange contracts, accounts receivable, and convertible notes. We manage our credit\nrisk exposure through timely assessment of our counterparty creditworthiness, credit limits, and use of collateral\nmanagement. Foreign exchange contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing.\nAccounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the\nworld. We manage our credit risk exposure by performing ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we\nlimit the amount of credit we extend. We generally do not require collateral from our customers.\nCash Equivalents\nWe invest excess cash primarily in asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, corporate debt securities,\ngovernment bonds, money market funds, and time deposits.\nMarketable Securities\nWe classify all marketable debt securities that have effective maturities of three months or less from the date of\npurchase as cash equivalents and those with effective maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities\non our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable\ndebt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. We have\nclassified and accounted for our marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. After consideration of our risk versus\nreward objectives, as well as our liquidity requirements, we may sell these debt securities prior to their effective\nmaturities. As we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify highly liquid securities\nwith maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets. We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a\ncomponent of stockholders\u2019 equity, except for the changes in allowance for expected credit losses, which are recorded\nin OI&E. For certain marketable debt securities we have elected the fair value option, for which changes in fair value\nare recorded in OI&E. We determine any realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable debt securities on a\nspecific identification method, and we record such gains and losses as a component of OI&E.\nOur investments in marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with the related gains and losses,\nincluding unrealized, recognized in OI&E. We classify our marketable equity securities subject to long-term lock-up\nrestrictions beyond 12 months as other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNon-Marketable Securities\nNon-marketable securities primarily consist of equity securities. We account for non-marketable equity securities\nthrough which we exercise significant influence but do not have control over the investee under the equity method.\nOther non-marketable equity securities that we hold are primarily accounted for under the measurement alternative.\nUnder the measurement alternative, the carrying value is measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus\nchanges resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the\nsame issuer. Adjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date and are\nrecorded as a component of OI&E.\n60.",

We have agreed\nto defend and/or hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or\nout of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit\nthe time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered\ninto indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification\nobligations to our agents.\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification\nagreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the\npayments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations,\ncash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future\npayments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows\nin a particular period.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably\npossible.\nLegal Matters\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be\nreasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be\nestimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect\nthe amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses\ndisclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.\nCertain outstanding matters seek speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts, substantial\nchanges to our business practices and products, or structural remedies. Significant judgment is required to determine\nboth the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and we may be\nunable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of outstanding legal matters are\ninherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either individually or in aggregate, have a\nmaterial adverse effect.\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\nAntitrust Matters\nWe are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations as well as litigation on various competition\nmatters by regulatory authorities and private parties in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally, including the\nfollowing:\n\u2022 Shopping: In June 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google relating to its\ndisplay and ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European antitrust laws and imposed a \u20ac2.4\nbillion fine.

Other uses of cash from operating activities include\npayments to suppliers for hardware, to tax authorities for income taxes, and other general corporate expenditures.\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased from 2021 to 2022 primarily due to the net effect of an\nincrease in cash received from revenues, offset by increases in cash paid for cost of revenues and operating expenses\nand an increase in tax payments driven by the effects of capitalization and amortization of R&D expenses beginning in\n2022 as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nCash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of investments in marketable and\nnon-marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of marketable and non-\nmarketable securities, purchases of property and equipment, and payments for acquisitions.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased from 2021 to 2022 as a result of a decrease in net purchases of\nand maturities and sales of marketable securities, partially offset by an increase in purchases of property and\nequipment.\nCash Used in Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from the\nsale of interest in consolidated entities. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of stock, net\npayments related to stock-based award activities, and repayments of debt.\nNet cash used in financing activities increased from 2021 to 2022 primarily due to an increase in repurchases of\nstock.\nLiquidity and Material Cash Requirements\nWe expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, cash flows from operations and\nfinancing activities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and\nfinancing activities for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\nCapital Expenditures and Leases\nWe make investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology assets\nthrough purchases of property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our\nservices and products.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories:\n\u2022 technical infrastructure, which consists of our investments in servers and network equipment for computing,\nstorage, and networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including AI, (collectively referred to as\nour information technology assets) and data center land and building construction; and\n\u2022 office facilities, ground-up development projects, and building improvements (also referred to as \"fit-outs\").\nConstruction in progress consists primarily of technical infrastructure and office facilities which have not yet been\nplaced in service. The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend from\nmonths to years. For example, our data center construction projects are generally multi-year projects with multiple\n37",

Depreciation of our property and equipment commences when the deployment of such\nassets are completed and are ready for our intended use. Land is not depreciated. For the years ended December 31,\n2021 and 2022, our depreciation and impairment expenses on property and equipment were $11.6 billion and $15.3\nbillion, respectively.\nLeases\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, we recognized total operating lease assets of $3.0 billion and\n$4.4 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the amount of total future lease payments under operating leases,\nwhich had a weighted average remaining lease term of 8 years, was $17.4 billion, of which $3.0 billion is short-term. As\nof December 31, 2022, we have entered into leases that have not yet commenced with future short-term and long-term\nlease payments of $630 million and $3.1 billion that are not yet recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These\nleases will commence between 2023 and 2026 with non-cancelable lease terms of 1 to 25 years.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, our operating lease expenses (including variable lease costs)\nwere $3.4 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. Finance lease costs were not material for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2022. See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for further information on leases.\nFinancing\nWe have a short-term debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net\nproceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2022, we had no\ncommercial paper outstanding.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, $4.0 billion expiring in April 2023 and\n$6.0 billion expiring in April 2026. The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using\ncertain market rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals. No amounts have\nbeen borrowed under the credit facilities.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with a total carrying value of $12.9 billion\nwith short-term and long-term future interest payments of $231 million and $3.8 billion, respectively. See Note 6 of the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further\ninformation on our debt.\nWe primarily utilize contract manufacturers for the assembly of our servers used in our technical infrastructure\nand hardware products we sell. We have agreements where we may purchase components directly from suppliers and\nthen supply these components to contract manufacturers for use in the assembly of the servers and hardware\nproducts. Certain of these arrangements result in a portion of the cash received from and paid to the contract\nmanufacturers to be presented as financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in Item 8\nof this Annual Report on From 10-K.\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn April 2022, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $70.0 billion of its\nClass A and Class C shares. As of December 31, 2022, $28.1 billion remains available for Class A and Class C share\nrepurchases. In accordance with the authorization of the Board of Directors of Alphabet, during 2022 we repurchased\nand subsequently retired 530 million shares for $59.3 billion. Of the aggregate amount repurchased and subsequently\nretired, 61 million shares were Class A stock for $6.7 billion and 469 million shares were Class C stock for $52.6 billion.\nSee Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEuropean Commission Fines\nIn 2017, 2018 and 2019, the EC announced decisions that certain actions taken by Google infringed European\ncompetition law and imposed fines of \u20ac2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017), \u20ac4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of\nJune 30, 2018), and \u20ac1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019), respectively. On September 14, 2022, the General\nCourt reduced the 2018 fine from \u20ac4.3 billion to \u20ac4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal to the European Court of\nJustice. In 2018 we recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in 2022.\nWhile each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities\non our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines.

Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer\ncontracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenues. The amount and timing of revenue\nrecognition for these commitments is largely driven by when our customers utilize services and our ability to deliver\nin accordance with relevant contract terms, which could affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when we expect\nto recognize such as revenues. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as\namounts that will be invoiced in future periods and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or\nless and cancellable contracts.\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance,\nincluding amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other.\nTotal deferred revenue as of December 31, 2021 was $3.8 billion, of which $1.4 billion was recognized as revenues\nduring the three months ended March 31, 2022.\nNote 3. Financial Instruments\nDebt Securities\nWe classify our marketable debt securities, which are accounted for as available-for-sale, within Level 2 in the\nfair value hierarchy because we use quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and\nmodels utilizing market observable inputs to determine fair value.\nFor certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value\nare recorded in other income (expense), net. The fair value option was elected for these securities to align with the\nunrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts. Unrealized net losses related to debt securities still\nheld where we have elected the fair value option were $35 million and $236 million as of December 31, 2021 and\nMarch 31, 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, the fair value of these debt securities\nwas $4.7 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively.\nThe following tables summarize debt securities, for which we did not elect the fair value option, by significant\ninvestment categories (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2021\nGross Gross Cash and\nAdjusted Unrealized Unrealized Fair Cash Marketable\nCost Gains Losses Value Equivalents Securities\nLevel 2:\nTime deposits(1) $ 5,133 $ 0 $ 0 $ 5,133 $ 5,133 $ 0\nGovernment bonds 53,288 258 (238) 53,308 5 53,303\nCorporate debt securities 35,605 194 (223) 35,576 12 35,564\nMortgage-backed and asset-backed\nsecurities 18,829 96 (112) 18,813 0 18,813\nTotal $ 112,855 $ 548 $ (573) $ 112,830 $ 5,150 $ 107,680\n11",

We have determined that the single source of our exposure to\nthese VIEs is our capital investments in them. The carrying value and maximum exposure of these unconsolidated\nVIEs were $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2021 and $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion,\nrespectively, as of March 31, 2022.\nNote 5.

We may redeem the notes at any time in whole or in part at specified redemption prices. The effective interest\nrates are based on proceeds received with interest payable semi-annually.\nThe total estimated fair value of the outstanding notes was approximately $12.4 billion and $11.4 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, respectively.

The increase in property and equipment was primarily due to\nthe purchases of office facilities.\nCash Used in Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from\nthe sale of interest in consolidated entities. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of\nstock, net payments related to stock-based award activities, and repayments of debt.\nNet cash used in financing activities increased from the three months ended March 31, 2021 to the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2022 primarily due to an increase in repurchases of stock.\nLiquidity and Material Cash Requirements\nWe expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, cash flows from operations and\nfinancing activities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing\nand financing activities for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\nCapital Expenditures and Leases\nWe make investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology assets\nthrough purchases of property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our\nservices and products.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories:\n\u2022 technical infrastructure, which consists of investments in servers and network equipment for computing,\nstorage and networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including machine learning\n(collectively referred to as information technology assets) and data center land and building construction;\nand\n\u2022 office facilities, ground up development projects, and related building improvements.\nConstruction in progress consists primarily of technical infrastructure and office facilities which have not yet\nbeen placed in service for our intended use. The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these\nassets may extend from months to years. For example, our data center construction projects are generally multi-\nyear projects with multiple phases, where we acquire qualified land and buildings, construct buildings, and secure\nand install information technology assets.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022, capital expenditures were $5.9 billion and $9.8\nbillion, respectively. Depreciation of our property and equipment commences when the deployment of such assets\nare completed and are ready for our intended use. Land is not depreciated. For the three months ended March 31,\n2021 and 2022, depreciation and impairment expenses on property and equipment were $2.5 billion and $3.6\nbillion, respectively.\nLeases\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022, we recognized total operating lease assets of $769\nmillion and $915 million, respectively. As of March 31, 2022, the amount of total future lease payments under\noperating leases, which had a weighted average remaining lease term of 8 years, was $15.6 billion. As of March 31,\n2022, we have entered into leases that have not yet commenced with future lease payments of $5.8 billion,\nexcluding purchase options, that are not yet recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These leases will\ncommence between 2022 and 2026 with non-cancelable lease terms of 1 to 25 years.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022, our operating lease expenses (including variable lease\ncosts) were $794 million and $880 million, respectively. Finance lease costs were not material for the three months\nended March 31, 2021 and 2022.\nFinancing\nWe have a short-term debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper.\nNet proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of March 31, 2022, we had no\ncommercial paper outstanding.\nAs of March 31, 2022, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, $4.0 billion expiring in April 2022 and\n$6.0 billion expiring in April 2026.

        "text": "Financial filing text section: Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe use derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk\nmanaged is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows,\nearnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate\nfluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance\ninvestment returns.\nWe recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the\nderivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy\ncomprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at\ngross fair values. The accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation.\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge\ncertain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have\nmaturities of 24 months or less.\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and\nsubsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points\nand time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life\nof the hedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and\nthe amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.\nAs of March 31, 2023 the net accumulated loss on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect\nwas $55 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.\nFair Value Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our\nmarketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in\nthe assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net, along with the offsetting\ngains and losses of the related hedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in other income (expense), net.\nNet Investment Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks\nrelated to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of\nhedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude\nforward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in\nother income (expense), net.\nOther Derivatives\nWe enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to\nhedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the\nfunctional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting\nhedges are primarily recorded in other income (expense), net along with the foreign currency gains and losses on\nmonetary assets and liabilities.\nWe also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates,\ncommodity prices, credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns. From time to time, we enter into derivatives\nto hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains and losses arising from other\nderivatives are primarily reflected within the \u201cother\u201d component of other income (expense), net. See Note 6 for\nfurther details.\n16",

Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of\nstock, net payments related to stock-based award activities, and repayments of debt.\nNet cash used in financing activities increased from the three months ended March 31, 2022 to the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2023 primarily due to an increase in repurchases of stock partially offset by a decrease in\nnet payments related to stock-based award activities.\nLiquidity and Material Cash Requirements\nWe expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, cash flows from operations and\nfinancing activities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing\nand financing activities for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\nCapital Expenditures and Leases\nWe make investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology assets\nthrough purchases of property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our\nservices and products.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories:\n\u2022 technical infrastructure, which consists of our investments in servers and network equipment for computing,\nstorage, and networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including AI, (collectively referred to\nas our information technology assets) and data center land and building construction; and\n\u2022 office facilities, ground-up development projects, and building improvements (also referred to as \"fit-outs\").\nConstruction in progress consists primarily of technical infrastructure and office facilities which have not yet\nbeen placed in service. The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend\nfrom months to years. For example, our data center construction projects are generally multi-year projects with\nmultiple phases, where we acquire qualified land and buildings, construct buildings, and secure and install\ninformation technology assets.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2023, we spent $9.8 billion and $6.3 billion on capital\nexpenditures, respectively. Depreciation of our property and equipment commences when the deployment of such\nassets are completed and are ready for our intended use. Land is not depreciated. For the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2022 and 2023, our depreciation and impairment expenses on property and equipment were $3.6 billion\nand $3.1 billion, respectively.\nLeases\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2023, we recognized total operating lease assets of $915\nmillion and $1.1 billion, respectively. As of March 31, 2023, the amount of total future lease payments under\noperating leases, which had a weighted average remaining lease term of 8.4 years, was $18.0 billion. As of\nMarch 31, 2023, we have entered into leases that have not yet commenced with future lease payments of $3.0\nbillion, that are not yet recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These leases will commence between 2023\nand 2026 with non-cancelable lease terms of 1 to 25 years. As of March 31, 2023 our actions to optimize our office\nspace did not affect our operating lease obligations.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2023, our operating lease expenses (including variable lease\ncosts) were $880 million and $1.1 billion, respectively. Finance lease costs were not material for the three months\nended March 31, 2022 and 2023.\nFinancing\nWe have a short-term debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper.\nNet proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of March 31, 2023, we had no\ncommercial paper outstanding.\nAs of March 31, 2023, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, $4.0 billion expiring in April 2023 and\n$6.0 billion expiring in April 2026. In April 2023, we entered into a new $4.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring in\nApril 2024 and we also terminated the existing $6.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring in April 2026 and entered\ninto a new $6.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring in April 2028.

No amounts have been borrowed under the credit facilities.\nAs of March 31, 2023, we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with a total carrying value of $12.9 billion.\nSee Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form\n10-Q for further information on our debt.\nWe primarily utilize contract manufacturers for the assembly of our servers used in our technical infrastructure\nand hardware products we sell. We have agreements where we may purchase components directly from suppliers\nand then supply these components to contract manufacturers for use in the assembly of the servers and hardware\nproducts. Certain of these arrangements result in a portion of the cash received from and paid to the contract\nmanufacturers to be presented as financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in\nItem 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn April 2022, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $70.0 billion of its\nClass A and Class C shares. As of March 31, 2023, $13.1 billion remains available for Class A and Class C share\nrepurchases. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we repurchased and subsequently retired 157 million\nshares for $15.1 billion. Of the aggregate amount repurchased and subsequently retired, 21 million shares were\nClass A stock for $2.0 billion and 136 million shares were Class C stock for $13.1 billion.\nIn April 2023, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional\n$70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nThe U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was enacted on August 16, 2022 and requires a one percent excise\ntax on certain share repurchases in excess of shares issued for employee compensation made after December 31,\n2022. We do not expect this provision to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nEuropean Commission Fines\nIn 2017, 2018 and 2019, the EC announced decisions that certain actions taken by Google infringed European\ncompetition law and imposed fines of \u20ac2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017), \u20ac4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of\nJune 30, 2018), and \u20ac1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019), respectively. On September 14, 2022, the\nGeneral Court reduced the 2018 fine from \u20ac4.3 billion to \u20ac4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal to the\nEuropean Court of Justice.\nWhile each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities\non our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines. For\nfurther details, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q.\nTaxes\nAs of March 31, 2023, we had short-term and long-term income taxes payable of $1.6 billion and $4.2 billion\nrelated to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\"). As\npermitted by the Tax Act, we will pay the transition tax in annual interest-free installments through 2025. We also\nhave taxes payable of $5.5 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of March 31, 2023. Additionally, we\nare currently evaluating the timing of our 2023 federal tax payments due to payment deferral relief made available\nby the Internal Revenue Service to taxpayers headquartered in designated counties affected by flooding in\nCalifornia.\nOther\nWe expect the substantial majority of the $1.2 billion liability related to our January 2023 workforce reduction to\nbe settled in fiscal year 2023, subject to local law and consultation requirements.

In Google Services, we also generate cash\nthrough consumer subscriptions and the sale of apps and in-app purchases and devices. In Google Cloud, we\ngenerate cash through consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, collaboration tools,\nand other cloud services.\nOur primary uses of cash from operating activities include payments to distribution and Google Network\npartners, to employees for compensation, and to content providers.

Finance lease costs were not material for the three months\nended March 31, 2023 and 2024.\nFinancing\nWe have a short-term debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper.\nNet proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of March 31, 2024, we had no\ncommercial paper outstanding.\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, $4.0 billion expiring in April 2024 and\n$6.0 billion expiring in April 2028. In April 2024, we entered into a new $4.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring in\nApril 2025.The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using certain market rates, as\nwell as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals. No amounts have been borrowed under\nthe credit facilities.\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with a total carrying value of $11.9 billion.\nFor additional information, see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nWe primarily utilize contract manufacturers for the assembly of our servers used in our technical infrastructure\nand devices we sell. We have agreements where we may purchase components directly from suppliers and then\nsupply these components to contract manufacturers for use in the assembly of the servers and devices.

        "text": "Financial filing text section: Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\nConvertible Notes\nAs of December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, we had investments in convertible notes of $2.9 billion and\n$423 million, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2025, we converted $3.0 billion of our\nconvertible notes into equity securities, which included gains from conversion of $416 million. These gains were\nrecognized in OI&E within the Consolidated Statement of Income. See Note 7 for further details on OI&E.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe use derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk\nmanaged is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows,\nearnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate\nfluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance\ninvestment returns.\nWe recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the\nderivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy\ncomprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at\ngross fair values. The accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation.\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge\ncertain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States (U.S.) dollar. These\ncontracts have maturities of 24 months or less.\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and\nsubsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points\nand time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life\nof the hedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and\nthe amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.\nAs of March 31, 2025, the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect\nwas $151 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.\nFair Value Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our\nmarketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in\nthe assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OI&E, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the\nrelated hedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize\nchanges in the excluded component in OI&E.\nNet Investment Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks\nrelated to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of\nhedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude\nforward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in\nOI&E.\nOther Derivatives\nWe enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to\nhedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the\nfunctional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting\nhedges are primarily recorded in OI&E along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and\nliabilities.\nWe also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates,\ncommodity prices, and credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns. From time to time, we enter into\nderivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains and losses arising\nfrom other derivatives are primarily reflected within the \u201cother\u201d component of OI&E. See Note 7 for further details.\n16",

Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer\ncontracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenues. The amount and timing of revenue\nrecognition for these commitments is largely driven by when our customers utilize services and our ability to deliver\nin accordance with relevant contract terms, which could affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when we expect\nto recognize such as revenues. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as\namounts that will be invoiced in future periods and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or\nless and cancellable contracts.\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance,\nincluding amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other.\nTotal deferred revenue as of December 31, 2021 was $3.8 billion, of which $2.1 billion was recognized as revenues\nduring the six months ended June 30, 2022.\nNote 3. Financial Instruments\nDebt Securities\nWe classify our marketable debt securities, which are accounted for as available-for-sale, within Level 2 in the\nfair value hierarchy because we use quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and\nmodels utilizing market observable inputs to determine fair value.\nFor certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value\nare recorded in other income (expense), net. The fair value option was elected for these securities to align with the\nunrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts. Unrealized net losses related to debt securities still\nheld where we have elected the fair value option were $35 million and $602 million as of December 31, 2021 and\nJune 30, 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2022, the fair value of these debt securities\nwas $4.7 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively.\nThe following tables summarize debt securities, for which we did not elect the fair value option, by significant\ninvestment categories (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2021\nGross Gross Cash and\nAdjusted Unrealized Unrealized Fair Cash Marketable\nCost Gains Losses Value Equivalents Securities\nLevel 2:\nTime deposits(1) $ 5,133 $ 0 $ 0 $ 5,133 $ 5,133 $ 0\nGovernment bonds 53,288 258 (238) 53,308 5 53,303\nCorporate debt securities 35,605 194 (223) 35,576 12 35,564\nMortgage-backed and asset-backed\nsecurities 18,829 96 (112) 18,813 0 18,813\nTotal $ 112,855 $ 548 $ (573) $ 112,830 $ 5,150 $ 107,680\n12",

We have agreed to hold certain parties\nharmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property\ninfringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which\nan indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification\nagreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification\nagreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, we have\na limited history of prior indemnification claims and the payments we have made under such agreements have not\nhad a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent\nthat valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.\nAs of June 30, 2022, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably\npossible.\nLegal Matters\nAntitrust Investigations\nOn November 30, 2010, the EC's Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various\nantitrust-related complaints against us.\nOn June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display\nand ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law.

The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these\nassets may extend from months to years. For example, our data center construction projects are generally multi-\nyear projects with multiple phases, where we acquire qualified land and buildings, construct buildings, and secure\nand install information technology assets.\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, capital expenditures were $11.4 billion and $16.6 billion,\nrespectively. Depreciation of our property and equipment commences when the deployment of such assets are\ncompleted and are ready for our intended use. Land is not depreciated. For the six months ended June 30, 2021\nand 2022, depreciation and impairment expenses on property and equipment were $5.3 billion and $7.3 billion,\nrespectively.\nLeases\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, we recognized total operating lease assets of $1.6 billion\nand $2.2 billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2022, the amount of total future lease payments under operating\nleases, which had a weighted average remaining lease term of 9 years, was $16.2 billion. As of June 30, 2022, we\nhave entered into leases that have not yet commenced with future lease payments of $4.9 billion, excluding\npurchase options, that are not yet recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of marketable and\nnon-marketable securities, purchases of property and equipment, and payments for acquisitions.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased from the six months ended June 30, 2022 to the six months\nended June 30, 2023 as a result of an increase in net purchases of and maturities and sales of marketable\nsecurities, partially offset by a decrease in purchases of property and equipment.\nCash Used in Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from\nthe sale of interest in consolidated entities. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of\nstock, net payments related to stock-based award activities, and repayments of debt.\nNet cash used in financing activities increased from the six months ended June 30, 2022 to the six months\nended June 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in repurchases of stock partially offset by a decrease in net\npayments related to stock-based award activities.\nLiquidity and Material Cash Requirements\nWe expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, cash flows from operations and\nfinancing activities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing\nand financing activities for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\nCapital Expenditures and Leases\nWe make investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology assets\nthrough purchases of property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our\nservices and products.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories:\n\u2022 technical infrastructure, which consists of our investments in servers and network equipment for computing,\nstorage, and networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including AI, (collectively referred to\nas our information technology assets) and data center land and building construction; and\n\u2022 office facilities, ground-up development projects, and building improvements (also referred to as \"fit-outs\").\nConstruction in progress consists primarily of technical infrastructure and office facilities which have not yet\nbeen placed in service. The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend\nfrom months to years. For example, our data center construction projects are generally multi-year projects with\nmultiple phases, where we acquire qualified land and buildings, construct buildings, and secure and install\ninformation technology assets.\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023, we spent $16.6 billion and $13.2 billion on capital\nexpenditures, respectively. We expect to continue to invest in our technical infrastructure, including servers, network\nequipment, and data centers, over the remainder of 2023 and into 2024 to support the growth of our business and\nour long-term initiatives, in particular in support of AI. Depreciation of our property and equipment commences when\nthe deployment of such assets are completed and are ready for our intended use. Land is not depreciated. For the\nsix months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023, our depreciation and impairment expenses on property and equipment\nwere $7.3 billion and $6.3 billion, respectively.\nLeases\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023, we recognized total operating lease assets of $2.2 billion\nand $1.7 billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2023, the amount of total future lease payments under operating\nleases, which had a weighted average remaining lease term of 8.2 years, was $18.2 billion. As of June 30, 2023, we\nhave entered into leases that have not yet commenced with future lease payments of $2.9 billion, that are not yet\nrecorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These leases will commence between 2023 and 2027 with non-\ncancelable lease terms of 1 to 34 years. As of June 30, 2023 our actions to optimize our office space did not affect\nour operating lease obligations.\n46",

As of June 30, 2023, we had no\ncommercial paper outstanding.\nAs of June 30, 2023, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, $4.0 billion expiring in April 2024 and\n$6.0 billion expiring in April 2028. The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using\ncertain market rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals. No amounts\nhave been borrowed under the credit facilities.\nAs of June 30, 2023, we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with a total carrying value of $12.9 billion.\nSee Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form\n10-Q for further information on our debt.\nWe primarily utilize contract manufacturers for the assembly of our servers used in our technical infrastructure\nand hardware products we sell. We have agreements where we may purchase components directly from suppliers\nand then supply these components to contract manufacturers for use in the assembly of the servers and hardware\nproducts. Certain of these arrangements result in a portion of the cash received from and paid to the contract\nmanufacturers to be presented as financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in\nItem 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nShare Repurchase Program\nDuring the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, we repurchased and subsequently retired 131 million\nand 288 million shares for $15.1 billion and $30.2 billion, respectively. Of the aggregate amount repurchased and\nsubsequently retired during the three months ended June 30, 2023, 17 million shares were Class A stock for $1.9\nbillion and 114 million shares were Class C stock for $13.2 billion. Of the aggregate amount repurchased and\nsubsequently retired during the six months ended June 30, 2023, 37 million shares were Class A stock for $3.9\nbillion and 251 million shares were Class C stock for $26.3 billion.\nIn April 2022, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $70.0 billion of its\nClass A and Class C shares. The repurchases from the April 2022 authorization were completed during the second\nquarter of 2023. In April 2023, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an\nadditional $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares. As of June 30, 2023, $68.1 billion remains available for\nClass A and Class C share repurchases.\nSee Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q.\nThe U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was enacted on August 16, 2022 and requires a one percent excise\ntax on certain share repurchases in excess of shares issued for employee compensation made after December 31,\n2022. We do not expect this provision to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nEuropean Commission Fines\nIn 2017, 2018 and 2019, the EC announced decisions that certain actions taken by Google infringed European\ncompetition law and imposed fines of \u20ac2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017), \u20ac4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of\nJune 30, 2018), and \u20ac1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019), respectively. On September 14, 2022, the\nGeneral Court reduced the 2018 fine from \u20ac4.3 billion to \u20ac4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal to the\nEuropean Court of Justice.\nWhile each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities\non our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines. For\nfurther details, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q.\nTaxes\nAs of June 30, 2023, we had short-term and long-term income taxes payable of $3.6 billion and $2.2 billion\nrelated to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\").

The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long-term growth\nof the business. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace, and form of capital\nreturn to stockholders.\nThe following table presents our cash flows (in millions):\nSix Months Ended\nJune 30,\n2023 2024\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 52,175 $ 55,488\nNet cash used in investing activities $ (13,746) $ (11,345)\nNet cash used in financing activities $ (34,403) $ (40,603)\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nOur largest source of cash provided by operations are advertising revenues generated by Google Search &\nother properties, Google Network properties, and YouTube properties. In Google Services, we also generate cash\nthrough consumer subscriptions, the sale of apps and in-app purchases, and devices. In Google Cloud, we\ngenerate cash through consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, collaboration tools,\nand other cloud services.\nOur primary uses of cash from operating activities include payments to distribution and Google Network\npartners, to employees for compensation, and to content providers. Other uses of cash from operating activities\ninclude payments to suppliers for devices, to tax authorities for income taxes, and other general corporate\nexpenditures.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased from the six months ended June 30, 2023 to the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2024 due to an increase in cash received from customers, partially offset by an increase in\ntax payments. The increase in tax payments in comparison to the prior year comparable period was primarily due to\nthe 2023 IRS payment deferral relief made available to taxpayers headquartered in designated counties in\nCalifornia.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nCash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of investments in marketable\nand non-marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of marketable and\nnon-marketable securities, purchases of property and equipment, and payments for acquisitions.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased from the six months ended June 30, 2023 to the six months\nended June 30, 2024 primarily due to an increase in maturities and sales of marketable securities, partially offset by\nincreases in purchases of property and equipment and purchases of marketable securities.\nCash Used in Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from\nthe sale of interests in consolidated entities. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of\nstock, net payments related to stock-based award activities, and repayments of debt.\nNet cash used in financing activities increased from the six months ended June 30, 2023 to the six months\nended June 30, 2024 due to dividend payments, increases in repurchases of stock, and net payments related to\nstock-based award activities.\nLiquidity and Material Cash Requirements\nWe expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, and cash flows from operations\nand financing activities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for\ninvesting and financing activities for at least the next 12 months, and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\n44",

The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend\nfrom months to years. For example, our data center construction projects are generally multi-year projects with\nmultiple phases, where we acquire land and buildings, construct buildings, and secure and install information\ntechnology assets.\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2024, we spent $13.2 billion and $25.2 billion on capital\nexpenditures, respectively. We expect to increase, relative to 2023, our investment in our technical infrastructure,\nincluding servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term\ninitiatives, in particular in support of AI products and services. Depreciation of our property and equipment\ncommences when the deployment of such assets are completed and are ready for our intended use. Land is not\ndepreciated. For the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2024, our depreciation on property and equipment was\n$5.5 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively.\nLeases\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2024, we recognized total operating lease assets of $1.7 billion\nand $897 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2024, the amount of total future lease payments under operating\nleases, which had a weighted average remaining lease term of 7.9 years, was $16.9 billion.\nAs of June 30, 2024, we have entered into leases that have not yet commenced with future lease payments of\n$5.2 billion, that are not yet recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These leases will commence between\n2024 and 2027 with non-cancelable lease terms of one to 25 years.\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2024, our operating lease expenses (including variable lease\ncosts) were $2.2 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. Finance lease costs were not material for the six months\nended June 30, 2023 and 2024.\nFinancing\nWe have a short-term debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper.\nNet proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of June 30, 2024, we had no\ncommercial paper outstanding.\nAs of June 30, 2024, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, $4.0 billion expiring in April 2025 and\n$6.0 billion expiring in April 2028.The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using\ncertain market rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals. No amounts\nhave been borrowed under the credit facilities.\nAs of June 30, 2024, we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with a total carrying value of $11.9 billion. For\nadditional information, see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nWe primarily utilize contract manufacturers for the assembly of our servers used in our technical infrastructure\nand devices we sell. We have agreements where we may purchase components directly from suppliers and then\nsupply these components to contract manufacturers for use in the assembly of the servers and devices. Certain of\nthese arrangements result in a portion of the cash received from and paid to the contract manufacturers to be\npresented as financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in Item 1 of this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q.\nShare Repurchase Program\n45",

        "text": "Financial filing text section: Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025, we had investments in convertible notes of $2.9 billion and $651\nmillion, respectively. During the six months ended June 30, 2025, we converted $3.0 billion of our convertible notes\ninto equity securities, which included gains from conversion of $416 million. These gains were recognized in OI&E\nwithin the Consolidated Statement of Income. See Note 7 for further details on OI&E.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe use derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk\nmanaged is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows,\nearnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate\nfluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance\ninvestment returns.\nWe recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the\nderivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy\ncomprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at\ngross fair values. The accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation.\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge\ncertain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States (U.S.) dollar. These\ncontracts have maturities of 24 months or less.\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and\nsubsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points\nand time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life\nof the hedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and\nthe amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.\nAs of June 30, 2025, the net accumulated loss on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect was\n$767 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.\nFair Value Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our\nmarketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in\nthe assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OI&E, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the\nrelated hedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize\nchanges in the excluded component in OI&E.\nNet Investment Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts, option contracts (including collars), and foreign currency-\ndenominated debt as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to our investment in foreign\nsubsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in\nAOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. For derivative instruments, we exclude forward points\nand time value from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in\nOI&E.\nWe had no foreign currency-denominated debt as of December 31, 2024 and $7.8 billion carrying value of\nforeign currency-denominated debt designated as net investment hedges as of June 30, 2025.\nOther Derivatives\nWe enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to\nhedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the\nfunctional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting\nhedges are primarily recorded in OI&E along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and\nliabilities.\nWe also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates,\ncommodity prices, and credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns. From time to time, we enter into\nderivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains and losses arising\nfrom other derivatives are primarily reflected within the \u201cother\u201d component of OI&E. See Note 7 for further details.\n18",

The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long-term growth\nof the business. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace, and form of capital\nreturn to stockholders.\nThe following table presents cash flows (in millions):\nSix Months Ended\nJune 30,\n2024 2025\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 55,488 $ 63,897\nNet cash used in investing activities $ (11,345) $ (40,738)\nNet cash used in financing activities $ (40,603) $ (26,033)\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nOur largest source of cash provided by operations are advertising revenues generated by Google Search &\nother properties, Google Network properties, and YouTube properties. In Google Services, we also generate cash\nthrough consumer subscriptions, the sale of apps and in-app purchases, and devices. In Google Cloud, we\ngenerate cash through consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, applications, and\nother cloud services.\nOur primary uses of cash from operating activities include payments to distribution and Google Network\npartners, to employees for compensation, and to content providers. Other uses of cash from operating activities\ninclude payments to suppliers for devices, to tax authorities for income taxes, and other general corporate\nexpenditures.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased from the six months ended June 30, 2024 to the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2025 due to an increase in cash received from customers, partially offset by an increase in\ncash payments for cost of revenues and operating expenses and an increase in income tax payments.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nCash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of investments in marketable\nand non-marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of marketable and\nnon-marketable securities, purchases of property and equipment, and payments for acquisitions.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased from the six months ended June 30, 2024 to the six months\nended June 30, 2025 primarily due to a decrease in maturities and sales of marketable securities and an increase in\npurchases of property and equipment primarily driven by investments in technical infrastructure.\nCash Used in Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from\nthe sale of interests in consolidated entities. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of\nstock, net payments related to stock-based award activities, payment of dividends, and repayments of debt.\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased from the six months ended June 30, 2024 to the six months\nended June 30, 2025 due to an increase in proceeds from issuance of debt, net of repayments.\n48",

Other uses of cash from operating activities\ninclude payments to suppliers for hardware, to tax authorities for income taxes, and other general corporate\nexpenditures.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the increase in cash received from customers and the 2023 IRS\npayment deferral relief made available to taxpayers headquartered in designated counties in California, partially\noffset by increased cash payments for costs and expenses. On October 16, 2023, we made an estimated income\ntax payment to the IRS of $10.5 billion that will be reflected in our fourth quarter operating cash flow.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nCash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of investments in marketable\nand non-marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of marketable and\nnon-marketable securities, purchases of property and equipment, and payments for acquisitions.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 as a result of an increase in net purchases of and maturities and sales of\nmarketable securities, partially offset by a decrease in payments for acquisitions and intangible assets.\nCash Used in Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from\nthe sale of interest in consolidated entities. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of\nstock, net payments related to stock-based award activities, and repayments of debt.\nNet cash used in financing activities increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in repurchases of stock partially offset by a\ndecrease in net payments related to debt.\nLiquidity and Material Cash Requirements\nWe expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, cash flows from operations and\nfinancing activities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing\nand financing activities for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\nCapital Expenditures and Leases\nWe make investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology assets\nthrough purchases of property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our\nservices and products.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories:\n\u2022 technical infrastructure, which consists of our investments in servers and network equipment for computing,\nstorage, and networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including AI, (collectively referred to\nas our information technology assets) and data center land and building construction; and\n\u2022 office facilities, ground-up development projects, and building improvements (also referred to as \"fit-outs\").\nConstruction in progress consists primarily of technical infrastructure and office facilities which have not yet\nbeen placed in service. The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend\nfrom months to years. For example, our data center construction projects are generally multi-year projects with\nmultiple phases, where we acquire qualified land and buildings, construct buildings, and secure and install\ninformation technology assets.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2023, we spent $23.9 billion and $21.2 billion on\ncapital expenditures, respectively. We expect to continue to invest in our technical infrastructure, including servers,\nnetwork equipment, and data centers, over the remainder of 2023 and into 2024 to support the growth of our\nbusiness and our long-term initiatives, in particular in support of AI. Depreciation of our property and equipment\ncommences when the deployment of such assets are completed and are ready for our intended use. Land is not\ndepreciated.

We do not expect this provision to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nEuropean Commission Fines\nIn 2017, 2018 and 2019, the EC announced decisions that certain actions taken by Google infringed European\ncompetition law and imposed fines of \u20ac2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017), \u20ac4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of\nJune 30, 2018), and \u20ac1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019), respectively. On September 14, 2022, the\nGeneral Court reduced the 2018 fine from \u20ac4.3 billion to \u20ac4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal to the\nEuropean Court of Justice.\nWhile each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities\non our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines.

Variable Interest Entities\nConsolidated VIEs\nWe consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of\noperations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.\nFor certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us, and their creditors do not have recourse to\nus. As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these\nVIEs were $4.9 billion and $7.8 billion, respectively and are primarily included in cash and cash equivalents on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, liabilities for which creditors only\nhave recourse to the VIEs were $2.5 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing\noperations of certain VIEs that are included within Other Bets.\nWaymo, a fully autonomous driving technology company and a consolidated VIE, received $4.8 billion in\nfunding during the three months ended September 30, 2024, followed by an additional $860 million in October 2024.\nThe majority of the total funding of $5.6 billion was provided by Alphabet. Investments from external parties were\naccounted for as equity transactions and resulted in recognition of noncontrolling interests.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, total noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated\nsubsidiaries were $3.4 billion, of which $1.1 billion was redeemable noncontrolling interests (RNCI) for both periods.\nNCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was not\nmaterial for any period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of OI&E. See Note 6 for further\ndetails on OI&E.\nUnconsolidated VIEs\nWe have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private\ncompanies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve\npower generation using renewable sources.\nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that\nwould significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results\nof operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We\naccount for these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments, which\nare included within non-marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The maximum exposure of\nthese unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the investments and any future\nfunding commitments. As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, our future funding commitments related\nto unconsolidated VIE investments were $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively.\nNote 5. Debt\nShort-Term Debt\nWe have a debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net\nproceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as\nof December 31, 2023 and $1.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted-average effective interest\nrate of 4.8% as of September 30, 2024. The estimated fair value of the commercial paper approximated its carrying\nvalue as of September 30, 2024.\n21",

The increase in tax payments in\ncomparison to the prior year comparable period was primarily due to the 2023 IRS payment deferral relief made\navailable to taxpayers headquartered in designated counties in California.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nCash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of investments in marketable\nand non-marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of marketable and\nnon-marketable securities, purchases of property and equipment, and payments for acquisitions and purchases of\nintangible assets.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to an increase in purchases of property and equipment and\npurchases of marketable securities, partially offset by increases in maturities and sales of marketable securities.\nCash Used in Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from\nthe sale of interests in consolidated entities. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of\nstock, net payments related to stock-based award activities, payment of dividends, and repayments of debt.\nNet cash used in financing activities increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 due to dividend payments and net payments related to stock-based award\nactivities.\nLiquidity and Material Cash Requirements\nWe expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, and cash flows from operations\nand financing activities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for\ninvesting and financing activities for at least the next 12 months, and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\nCapital Expenditures and Leases\nWe make investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology assets\nthrough purchases of property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our\nservices and products.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories:\n\u2022 technical infrastructure, which consists of our investments in servers and network equipment for computing,\nstorage, and networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including AI, (collectively referred to\nas our information technology assets) and data center land and building construction; and\n\u2022 office facilities, ground-up development projects, and building improvements (also referred to as \"fit-outs\").\nConstruction in progress consists primarily of technical infrastructure and office facilities which have not yet\nbeen placed in service. The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend\nfrom months to years. For example, our data center construction projects are generally multi-year projects with\nmultiple phases, where we acquire land and buildings, construct buildings, and secure and install information\ntechnology assets.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, we spent $21.2 billion and $38.3 billion on\ncapital expenditures, respectively. We expect to increase, relative to 2023, our investment in our technical\ninfrastructure, including servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and\nour long-term initiatives, in particular in support of AI products and services. Depreciation of our property and\nequipment commences when the deployment of such assets are completed and are ready for our intended use.\nLand is not depreciated.

We\nsubsequently appealed the General Court's decision to the European Court of Justice.\nOn September 10, 2024, the European Court of Justice rejected our appeal of the 2017 decision and upheld\nthe \u20ac2.4 billion fine. In the third quarter of 2024, we made a cash payment of $3.0 billion for the 2017 shopping fine.\nOn September 18, 2024, the EU's General Court overturned the 2019 decision and annulled the \u20ac1.5 billion\nfine. The EC has until November 28, 2024 to appeal the decision.\nWe included the EC fines, including any under appeal, in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheets, as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines.
