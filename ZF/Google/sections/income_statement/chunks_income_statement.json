The TAC rate decreased from 21.8% to 21.4% from 2022 to\n2023 primarily due to a revenue mix shift from Google Network properties to Google Search & other properties. The\nTAC rate on Google Search & other revenues and the TAC rate on Google Network revenues were both substantially\nconsistent from 2022 to 2023.\nThe increase in other cost of revenues from 2022 to 2023 was primarily due to increases in content acquisition\ncosts, largely for YouTube, and compensation expenses, which included $479 million of charges related to employee\nseverance associated with the reduction in our workforce. Additionally, other cost of revenues benefited from a\nreduction in depreciation expense due to the change in estimated useful lives of our servers and network equipment.\nThe increase in other cost of revenues of $11.9 billion from 2021 to 2022 was primarily due to increases in device\ncosts, compensation expenses, depreciation, and equipment-related expenses.\nResearch and Development\nThe following table presents R&D expenses (in millions, except percentages):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2023\nResearch and development expenses $ 39,500 $ 45,427\nResearch and development expenses as a percentage of revenues 14 % 15 %\nR&D expenses increased $5.9 billion from 2022 to 2023 primarily driven by an increase in compensation\nexpenses of $2.9 billion, $870 million in charges related to our office space optimization efforts, and an increase in\ndepreciation expense of $722 million. The $2.9 billion increase in compensation expenses was largely the result of a\n4% increase in average headcount, after adjusting for roles affected by the reduction in our workforce, and an increase\nin SBC expense. Additionally, the increase in compensation expenses included $848 million in employee severance\ncharges associated with the reduction in our workforce. The $722 million increase in depreciation expense reflected an\noffsetting benefit of the change in the estimated useful lives of our servers and network equipment.\nSales and Marketing\nThe following table presents sales and marketing expenses (in millions, except percentages):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2023\nSales and marketing expenses $ 26,567 $ 27,917\nSales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues 9 % 9 %\nSales and marketing expenses increased $1.4 billion from 2022 to 2023, primarily driven by an increase in\ncompensation expenses of $1.6 billion, partially offset by a decrease in advertising and promotional activities of $441\nmillion. The $1.6 billion increase in compensation expenses was largely the result of $497 million in employee\nseverance charges associated with the reduction in our workforce in addition to a combination of other factors, none of\nwhich were individually significant.\n38.",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August\n2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became\nthe successor issuer to Google.\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide\nenterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales\nof other products and services, such as fees received for consumer subscription-based products, apps and in-app\npurchases, and devices.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated\nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes.\nActual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our\nestimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; content licenses; contingent liabilities; fair values\nof financial instruments and goodwill; income taxes; inventory; and useful lives of property and equipment, among\nothers. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable,\nand the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and\nadjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain\nnetwork equipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal\nyear 2023. Based on the carrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December 31, 2022, and those\nplaced in service during the year ended December 31, 2023, the effect of this change in estimate was a reduction in\ndepreciation expense of $3.9 billion and an increase in net income of $3.0 billion, or $0.24 per basic and $0.24 per\ndiluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, and\nthe collectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or services is probable. Sales and other\nsimilar taxes are excluded from revenues.\nAdvertising Revenues\nWe generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on:\n\u2022 Google Search and other properties, including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners\nwho use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated\nproperties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n\u2022 YouTube properties; and\n\u2022 Google Network properties, including revenues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob,\nAdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\nOur customers generally purchase advertising inventory through Google Ads, Google Ad Manager, Google\nDisplay & Video 360, and Google Marketing Platform, among others.\nWe offer advertising by delivering both performance and brand advertising. We recognize revenues for\nperformance advertising when a user engages with the advertisement. For brand advertising, we recognize revenues\nwhen the ad is displayed, or a user views the ad.\nFor ads placed on Google Network properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on\na gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed\non Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues,\n56.",

Where we are the principal, we\ncontrol the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to\nmonetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being\nprimarily responsible to our customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing.\nGoogle Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues consist of revenues from:\n\u2022 consumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such YouTube TV, YouTube\nMusic and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;\n\u2022 platforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play from the sales of apps and in-app purchases;\n\u2022 devices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices; and\n\u2022 other products and services.\nSubscription revenues are recognized ratably over the period of the subscription, primarily monthly. We report\nrevenues from Google Play app sales and in-app purchases on a net basis, because our performance obligation is to\nfacilitate a transaction between app developers and end users, for which we earn a service fee.\nGoogle Cloud Revenues\nGoogle Cloud revenues consist of revenues from:\n\u2022 Google Cloud Platform, which generates consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure,\nplatform, and other services. These services provide access to solutions such as cybersecurity, databases,\nanalytics, and AI offerings including our AI infrastructure, Vertex AI platform, and Duet AI for Google Cloud;\n\u2022 Google Workspace, which includes subscriptions for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for\nenterprises, such as Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Drive, and Meet, with integrated features like Duet AI in Google\nWorkspace; and\n\u2022 other enterprise services.\nOur cloud services are generally provided on either a consumption or subscription basis and may have contract\nterms longer than a year. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis are recognized when\nthe customer utilizes the services, based on the quantity of services consumed. Revenues related to cloud services\nprovided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer receives and\nconsumes the benefits of the cloud services.\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate\nrevenues to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine\nstandalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers.\nCustomer Incentives and Credits\nCertain customers receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration.\nWe estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues. We\nbelieve that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration.\nSales Commissions\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred when the period of the expected benefit is one year or less. We\nrecognize an asset for certain sales commissions and amortize if the expected benefit period is greater than one year.\nThese costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues consists of TAC and other costs of revenues.\n\u2022 TAC includes:\n\u25e6 amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services.\nOur distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers,\nand software developers; and\n\u25e6 amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n57.",

Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future\nservices that have not yet been recognized as revenue. The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue\nrecognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms\nand when our customers utilize services. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as\nrevenues over the next 24 months with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related\ndeferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts\nwith an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.\nDeferred Revenues\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including\namounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google subscriptions,\nplatforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2022 was $4.5 billion, of which $2.4 billion was\nrecognized as revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nNote 3.

We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP\npercentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for financial\nand operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the\npresentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles\n(GAAP) results helps improve the ability to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign\ncurrency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant\nperiod over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency\nexchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level.\nWe use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year\nbasis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable\nperiod exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.\nConstant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period\nrevenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated\nusing prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods.\nThese results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with\nGAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures\nused by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\n37.",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August\n2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became\nthe successor issuer to Google.\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide\nenterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure, platform services, and applications; sales of other products and\nservices, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and devices.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated\nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes.\nActual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our\nestimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; contingent liabilities; fair values of financial\ninstruments and goodwill; income taxes; inventory; and useful lives of property and equipment, among others. We\nbase our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable, and the\nresults of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, and\nthe collectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or services is probable. Sales and other\nsimilar taxes are excluded from revenues.\nAdvertising Revenues\nWe generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on:\n\u2022 Google Search and other properties, including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners\nwho use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated\nproperties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n\u2022 YouTube properties; and\n\u2022 Google Network properties, including revenues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob,\nAdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\nOur customers generally purchase advertising inventory through Google Ads, Google Ad Manager, Google\nDisplay & Video 360, and Google Marketing Platform, among others.\nWe offer advertising by delivering both performance and brand advertising. We recognize revenues for\nperformance advertising when a user engages with the advertisement. For brand advertising, we recognize revenues\nwhen the ad is displayed, or a user views the ad.\nFor ads placed on Google Network properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on\na gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed\non Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues,\nand amounts paid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of revenues. Where we are the principal, we\ncontrol the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to\nmonetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being\nprimarily responsible to our customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing.\nGoogle Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues consist of revenues from:\n57.",

We report\nrevenues from Google Play sales of apps and in-app purchases on a net basis because our performance obligation is\nto facilitate a transaction between app developers and end users for which we earn a service fee.\nGoogle Cloud Revenues\nGoogle Cloud revenues consist of revenues from:\n\u2022 Google Cloud Platform, which generates consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure,\nplatform, and other services. These services provide access to solutions such as AI offerings including our AI\ninfrastructure, Vertex AI platform, and Gemini for Google Cloud; cybersecurity; and data and analytics;\n\u2022 Google Workspace, which includes subscriptions for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for\nenterprises, such as Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Drive, and Meet, with integrated features like Gemini for Google\nWorkspace; and\n\u2022 other enterprise services.\nOur cloud services are generally provided on either a consumption or subscription basis and may have contract\nterms longer than a year. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis are recognized when\nthe customer utilizes the services, based on the quantity of services consumed. Revenues related to cloud services\nprovided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer receives and\nconsumes the benefits of the cloud services.\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate\nrevenues to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine\nstandalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers.\nCustomer Incentives and Credits\nCertain customers receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration.\nWe estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues. We\nbelieve that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration related to customer\nincentives and credits.\nSales Commissions\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred when the period of the expected benefit is one year or less. We\nrecognize an asset for certain sales commissions and amortize if the expected benefit period is greater than one year.\nThese costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues consists of TAC and other costs of revenues.\n\u2022 TAC includes:\n\u25e6 amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services.\nOur distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers,\nand software developers; and\n\u25e6 amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n\u2022 Other cost of revenues includes:\n\u25e6 content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and\nother content for distribution, primarily related to YouTube (we pay fees to these content providers\nbased on revenues generated, subscriber counts, or a flat fee);\n\u25e6 depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure;\n58.",

Revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services\nthat have not yet been recognized as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as\nrevenues over the next 24 months with the remainder to be recognized thereafter. The estimated revenue backlog and\ntiming of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with\nrelevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue\ncurrently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original\nexpected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.\nDeferred Revenues\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including\namounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google subscriptions,\nplatforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2023 was $5.0 billion, of which $3.9 billion was\nrecognized as revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based\nrevenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for\neach impression displayed to users.\nAs our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering,\nand counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues generated by\nthe corresponding click and impression activity.\nFluctuations in our advertising revenues, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search\n& other properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties and the\ncorrelation between these items have been and may continue to be affected by additional factors, such as:\n\u2022 advertiser competition for keywords;\n\u2022 changes in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy;\n\u2022 changes in device mix;\n\u2022 seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends, such as\ntraditional retail seasonality; and\n\u2022 traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various verticals and\nchannels.\nGoogle Other\nGoogle other revenues are comprised of the following:\n\u2022 Google Play, which includes sales of apps and in-app purchases;\n\u2022 hardware, which includes sales of Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, and Pixel devices;\n\u2022 YouTube non-advertising, which includes subscription revenues from services such as YouTube Premium and\nYouTube TV; and\n\u2022 other products and services.\n28",

Our operating expenses\ninclude costs related to R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of our costs and\nexpenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our\noperating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues.\n\u2022 TAC includes:\n\u25e6 Amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services.\nOur distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers,\nand software developers.\n\u25e6 Amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n\u2022 Other cost of revenues includes:\n\u25e6 Content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and\nother content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers\nbased on revenues generated or a flat fee).\n\u25e6 Expenses associated with our data centers (including bandwidth, compensation expenses,\ndepreciation, energy, and other equipment costs) as well as other operations costs (such as content\nreview as well as customer and product support costs).\n\u25e6 Inventory and other costs related to the hardware we sell.\nTAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly\nhigher than TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search & other properties,\nbecause most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our\nGoogle Network partners.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as either\nR&D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative.\nThe main components of our R&D expenses are:\n\u2022 compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&D related to our existing\nand new products and services;\n\u2022 depreciation; and\n\u2022 third-party services fees primarily relating to consulting and outsourced services in support of our engineering\nand product development efforts.\n29",

The increase in\ncost-per-impression from 2021 to 2022 was driven by a number of interrelated factors including ongoing product and\npolicy changes, improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery, changes in device mix, geographic mix,\nproduct mix, and property mix, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates.\nGoogle other revenues\nGoogle other revenues increased $1.0 billion from 2021 to 2022 primarily driven by growth in YouTube non-\nadvertising and hardware revenues, partially offset by a decrease in Google Play revenues. The growth in YouTube\nnon-advertising was largely due to an increase in paid subscribers. The growth in hardware was primarily driven by\nincreased sales of Pixel devices. The decrease in Google Play revenues was primarily driven by the fee structure\nchanges we announced in 2021 as well as a decrease in buyer spending. Additionally, the overall increase in Google\nother revenues was adversely affected by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates.\nGoogle Cloud\nGoogle Cloud revenues increased $7.1 billion from 2021 to 2022. The growth was primarily driven by Google\nCloud Platform followed by Google Workspace offerings. Google Cloud's infrastructure and platform services were the\nlargest drivers of growth in Google Cloud Platform.\nRevenues by Geography\nThe following table presents revenues by geography as a percentage of revenues, determined based on the\naddresses of our customers:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021 2022\nUnited States 46 % 48 %\nEMEA 31 % 29 %\nAPAC 18 % 16 %\nOther Americas 5 % 6 %\nHedging gains (losses) 0 % 1 %\nFor further details on revenues by geography, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nUse of Non-GAAP Constant Currency Information\nInternational revenues, which represent a significant portion of our revenues, are generally transacted in multiple\ncurrencies and therefore are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period\ncomparisons. We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP\npercentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for financial\nand operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the\npresentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles\n(GAAP) results helps improve the ability to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign\ncurrency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant\nperiod over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate\nmovements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We use constant\ncurrency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year basis. Constant\ncurrency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable period exchange\nrates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.\n33",

We recognize revenues for\nperformance advertising when a user engages with the advertisement, such as a click, a view, or a purchase. For\nbrand advertising, we recognize revenues when the ad is displayed, or a user views the ad.\nFor ads placed on Google Network properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on\na gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed\non Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues,\nand amounts paid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of revenues. Where we are the principal, we\ncontrol the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to\nmonetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being\nprimarily responsible to our customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing.\nGoogle Cloud Revenues\nGoogle Cloud revenues consist of revenues from:\n\u2022 Google Cloud Platform, which includes fees for infrastructure, platform, and other services;\n\u2022 Google Workspace, which includes fees for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for\nenterprises, such as Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar, and Meet; and\n\u2022 other enterprise services.\nOur cloud services are generally provided on either a consumption or subscription basis and may have contract\nterms longer than a year. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis are recognized when\nthe customer utilizes the services, based on the quantity of services consumed. Revenues related to cloud services\nprovided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer receives and\nconsumes the benefits of the cloud services.\nGoogle Other Revenues\nGoogle other revenues consist of revenues from:\n\u2022 Google Play, which includes sales of apps and in-app purchases;\n\u2022 hardware, which includes sales of Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, and Pixel devices;\n\u2022 YouTube non-advertising, which includes subscription revenues from services such as YouTube Premium and\nYouTube TV; and\n\u2022 other products and services.\nWe report revenues from Google Play app sales and in-app purchases on a net basis, because our performance\nobligation is to facilitate a transaction between app developers and end users, for which we earn a service fee.\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate\nrevenues to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine\nstandalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers.\nCustomer Incentives and Credits\nCertain customers receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration.\nWe estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues. We\nbelieve that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration.\nSales Commissions\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred when the amortization period (the period of the expected benefit)\nis one year or less. We recognize an asset for certain sales commissions if we expect the period of benefit of these\ncosts to exceed one year and recognize the expense over the amortization period. These costs are recorded within\nsales and marketing expenses.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues consists of TAC and other costs of revenues.\n\u2022 TAC includes:\n53",

Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future\nservices that have not yet been recognized as revenue. The amount and timing of revenue recognition for these\ncommitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our\ncustomers utilize services, which could affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when we expect to recognize such\nas revenue. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months\nwith the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded\nas well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one\nyear or less and cancellable contracts.\nDeferred Revenue\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including\namounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other.

If not utilized, the federal net\noperating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2023, foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in\n2025 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2028. It is more likely than not that the\nmajority of the net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized; therefore, we have recorded a valuation allowance\nagainst them. The net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various annual limitations under the tax laws of the\ndifferent jurisdictions.\nAs of December 31, 2022, our Federal and California research and development credit carryforwards for income\ntax purposes were approximately $400 million and $5.8 billion, respectively. If not utilized, the Federal R&D credit will\nbegin to expire in 2037 and the California R&D credit can be carried over indefinitely. We believe the majority of the\nfederal tax credit and state tax credit is not likely to be realized.\nAs of December 31, 2022, our investment tax credit carryforwards for state income tax purposes were\napproximately $931 million and will begin to expire in 2025. We use the flow-through method of accounting for\ninvestment tax credits. We believe this tax credit is not likely to be realized.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we maintained a valuation allowance with respect to California deferred tax assets,\ncertain federal net operating losses, certain state net operating losses and tax credits, net deferred tax assets relating\nto certain Other Bets, and certain foreign net operating losses that we believe are not likely to be realized. We continue\nto reassess the remaining valuation allowance quarterly, and if future evidence allows for a partial or full release of the\nvaluation allowance, a tax benefit will be recorded accordingly.\n81",

Significant judgment is required in\nevaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Total gross unrecognized tax\nbenefits were $5.2 billion and $5.4 billion as of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, respectively. Total\nunrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate were $3.7 billion and $3.9 billion as\nof December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, respectively.\nFor information regarding non-income taxes, see Note 9.\nNote 14. Information about Segments and Geographic Areas\nWe report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:\n\u2022 Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Google Maps,\nGoogle Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales\nof apps and in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-\nbased products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV.\n\u2022 Google Cloud includes Google\u2019s infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services\nfor enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues from fees received for Google Cloud Platform\nservices, Google Workspace collaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\n\u2022 Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues\nfrom Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\nRevenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering\nactivities, and hardware, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the\nintegrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are\nmanaged centrally at a consolidated level. The associated costs, including depreciation and impairment, are\nallocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage or headcount.\nUnallocated corporate costs primarily include corporate initiatives, corporate shared costs, such as finance and\nlegal, including certain fines and settlements, as well as costs associated with certain shared R&D activities.\nAdditionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are included in corporate costs.\nOur operating segments are not evaluated using asset information.\nThe following table presents information about segments (in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2021 2022\nRevenues:\nGoogle Services $ 51,178 $ 61,472\nGoogle Cloud 4,047 5,821\nOther Bets 198 440\nHedging gains (losses) (109) 278\nTotal revenues $ 55,314 $ 68,011\n28",

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS\nOF OPERATIONS\nPlease read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together\nwith \"Note About Forward-Looking Statements\" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes\nincluded under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2021, including Part I, Item 1A \"Risk Factors.\"\nUnderstanding Alphabet\u2019s Financial Results\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses \u2014 the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments,\nGoogle Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Other\nBets include earlier stage technologies that are further afield from our core Google business. For further details on\nour segments, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q.\nSeasonality and other\nOur advertising revenues are affected by seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and\nunderlying business trends, such as traditional retail seasonality. Additionally, our non-advertising revenues,\nincluding those generated from Google Cloud, Google Play, hardware, and YouTube, may be affected by\nfluctuations driven by changes in pricing, digital content releases, fee structures, new product and service launches,\nand other market dynamics, as well as seasonality.\nRevenues and Monetization Metrics\nGoogle Services\nGoogle Services revenues consist of revenues generated from advertising (\u201cGoogle advertising\u201d) as well as\nrevenues from other sources (\u201cGoogle other revenues\u201d).\nGoogle Advertising\nGoogle advertising revenues are comprised of the following:\n\u2022 Google Search & other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including\nrevenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search\nin browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and\nGoogle Play;\n\u2022 YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and\n\u2022 Google Network, which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob,\nAdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\nWe use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our\nadvertising revenues: paid clicks and cost-per-click pertain to traffic on Google Search & other properties, while\nimpressions and cost-per-impressions pertain to traffic on our Network partners\u2019 properties.\nPaid clicks represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users on Google\nsearch properties and other Google owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google\nPlay. Cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the\naverage amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.\nImpressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in\nAdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based\nrevenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for\neach impression displayed to users.\nAs our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring,\ngathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues\ngenerated by the corresponding click and impression activity.\nOur advertising revenue growth, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search &\nother properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties and the\ncorrelation between these items, have been affected and may continue to be affected by various factors, including:\n\u2022 advertiser competition for keywords;\n30",

The increase in cost-per-impression from the\nthree months ended March 31, 2021 to the three months ended March 31, 2022 was driven by a number of\ninterrelated factors including ongoing product and policy changes, improvements we have made in ad formats and\ndelivery, changes in device mix, geographic mix, product mix, and property mix.\nGoogle other revenues\nGoogle other revenues increased $317 million from the three months ended March 31, 2021 to the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2022. The growth was primarily driven by YouTube non-advertising, largely due to an\nincrease in paid subscribers. The overall growth was partially offset by a decline in Google Play revenues largely\ndriven by fee structure changes we announced in 2021.\nGoogle Cloud\nGoogle Cloud revenues increased $1.8 billion from the three months ended March 31, 2021 to the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2022. The growth was primarily driven by GCP followed by Google Workspace offerings.\nGoogle Cloud's infrastructure and platform services were the largest drivers of growth in GCP.\nRevenues by Geography\nThe following table presents revenues by geography as a percentage of revenues, determined based on the\naddresses of our customers:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2021 2022\nUnited States 45 % 47 %\nEMEA 31 % 30 %\nAPAC 19 % 17 %\nOther Americas 5 % 6 %\nFor further details on revenues by geography, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nUse of Constant Currency Revenues and Constant Currency Revenue Percentage Change\nThe effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period\ncomparisons. We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues and non-GAAP percentage change in constant\ncurrency revenues for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period\ncomparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps\nimprove the ability to understand our performance because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that\nare not indicative of our core operating results.\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant\nperiod over period. We define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the effect of foreign\nexchange rate movements and hedging activities, and use it to determine the constant currency revenue\npercentage change on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current\nperiod revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects\nrealized in the current period.\n35",

Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services\nthat have not yet been recognized as revenue. The amount and timing of revenue recognition for these\ncommitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our\ncustomers utilize services, which could affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when we expect to recognize\nsuch as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24\nmonths with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue\ncurrently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original\nexpected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.\nDeferred Revenues\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance,\nincluding amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other.\nTotal deferred revenue as of December 31, 2022 was $4.5 billion, of which $1.6 billion was recognized as revenues\nduring the three months ended March 31, 2023.\n11",

We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP\npercentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for\nfinancial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe\nthe presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting\nPrinciples (GAAP) results helps improve the ability to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects\nof foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant\nperiod over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate\nmovements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We use\nconstant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year\nbasis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year\ncomparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.\nConstant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period\nrevenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are\n36",

Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment\nmanufacturers, and software developers; and\n\u25e6 amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n\u2022 Other cost of revenues primarily includes:\n\u25e6 compensation expense related to our data centers and other operations such as content review and\ncustomer and product support;\n\u25e6 content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video\nand other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content\nproviders based on revenues generated or a flat fee);\n\u25e6 depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure; and\n\u25e6 inventory and other costs related to the devices we sell.\nTAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly\nhigher than TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search & other properties,\nbecause most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our\nGoogle Network partners.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as\neither R&D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative.\nThe main components of our R&D expenses are:\n\u2022 compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&D related to our\nexisting and new products and services;\n\u2022 depreciation; and\n\u2022 third-party services fees primarily relating to consulting and outsourced services in support of our\nengineering and product development efforts.\nThe main components of our sales and marketing expenses are:\n\u2022 compensation expenses for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain\ncustomer service functions; and\n\u2022 spending relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services.\nThe main components of our general and administrative expenses are:\n\u2022 compensation expenses for employees in finance, human resources, information technology, legal, and\nother administrative support functions;\n\u2022 expenses relating to legal matters, including certain fines and settlements; and\n\u2022 third-party services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and other outsourced administrative\nservices.\n31",

We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP\npercentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for\nfinancial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe\nthe presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to\nunderstand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of\nour core operating results.\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant\nperiod over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency\nexchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated\nlevel. We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a\nyear-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior\nyear comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.\nConstant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period\nrevenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are\ntranslated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of\nboth periods.\nThese results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with\nGAAP.

Information about Segments and Geographic Areas\nWe report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:\n\u2022 Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Google Maps,\nGoogle Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales\nof apps and in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-\nbased products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV.\n\u2022 Google Cloud includes Google\u2019s infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services\nfor enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues from fees received for Google Cloud Platform\nservices, Google Workspace collaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\n\u2022 Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues\nfrom Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\nRevenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering\nactivities, and hardware, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the\nintegrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are\nmanaged centrally at a consolidated level. The associated costs, including depreciation and impairment, are\nallocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage or headcount.\nUnallocated corporate costs primarily include corporate initiatives, corporate shared costs, such as finance and\nlegal, including certain fines and settlements, as well as costs associated with certain shared R&D activities.\nAdditionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are included in corporate costs.\nOur operating segments are not evaluated using asset information.\nThe following table presents information about our segments (in millions):\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n2021 2022 2021 2022\nRevenues:\nGoogle Services $ 57,067 $ 62,841 $ 108,245 $ 124,313\nGoogle Cloud 4,628 6,276 8,675 12,097\nOther Bets 192 193 390 633\nHedging gains (losses) (7) 375 (116) 653\nTotal revenues $ 61,880 $ 69,685 $ 117,194 $ 137,696\n31",

We report Google in two segments,\nGoogle Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Other\nBets include earlier stage technologies that are further afield from our core Google business. For further details on\nour segments, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q.\nSeasonality and other\nOur advertising revenues are affected by seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and\nunderlying business trends, such as traditional retail seasonality. Additionally, our non-advertising revenues,\nincluding those generated from Google Cloud, Google Play, hardware, and YouTube, may be affected by\nfluctuations driven by changes in pricing, digital content releases, fee structures, new product and service launches,\nand other market dynamics, as well as seasonality.\nRevenues and Monetization Metrics\nGoogle Services\nGoogle Services revenues consist of revenues generated from advertising (\u201cGoogle advertising\u201d) as well as\nrevenues from other sources (\u201cGoogle other revenues\u201d).\nGoogle Advertising\nGoogle advertising revenues are comprised of the following:\n\u2022 Google Search & other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including\nrevenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search\nin browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and\nGoogle Play;\n\u2022 YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and\n\u2022 Google Network, which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob,\nAdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\nWe use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our\nadvertising revenues: paid clicks and cost-per-click pertain to traffic on Google Search & other properties, while\nimpressions and cost-per-impressions pertain to traffic on our Network partners\u2019 properties.\nPaid clicks represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users on Google\nsearch properties and other Google owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google\nPlay. Cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the\naverage amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.\nImpressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in\nAdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based\nrevenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for\neach impression displayed to users.\nAs our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring,\ngathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues\ngenerated by the corresponding click and impression activity.\nOur advertising revenue growth, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search &\nother properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties and the\ncorrelation between these items, have been affected and may continue to be affected by various factors, including:\n\u2022 advertiser competition for keywords;\n33",

Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services\nthat have not yet been recognized as revenue. The amount and timing of revenue recognition for these\ncommitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our\ncustomers utilize services, which could affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when we expect to recognize\nsuch as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24\nmonths with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue\ncurrently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original\nexpected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.\nDeferred Revenues\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance,\nincluding amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other.\nTotal deferred revenue as of December 31, 2022 was $4.5 billion, of which $2.1 billion was recognized as revenues\nduring the six months ended June 30, 2023.\n12",

Information about Segments and Geographic Areas\nWe report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:\n\u2022 Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Google Maps,\nGoogle Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales\nof apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products such as\nYouTube Premium and YouTube TV.\n\u2022 Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for\nenterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues from fees received for Google Cloud Platform\nservices, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\n\u2022 Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues\nfrom Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\nRevenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering\nactivities, and hardware, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the\nintegrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are\nmanaged centrally at a consolidated level. These costs, including the associated depreciation and impairment, are\nallocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage, headcount, or revenue.\nReflecting DeepMind's increasing collaboration with Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets,\nbeginning in the first quarter of 2023 DeepMind is reported as part of Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs instead\nof within Other Bets. Additionally, beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we updated and simplified our cost allocation\nmethodologies to provide our business leaders with increased transparency for decision-making. Prior periods have\nbeen recast to conform to the current presentation.\nAs announced on April 20, 2023, we brought together part of Google Research (the Brain team) and DeepMind\nto significantly accelerate our progress in artificial intelligence (AI). The group, called Google DeepMind, is reported\nwithin Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs prospectively beginning in the second quarter of 2023. Previously, the\nBrain team was included within Google Services.\nCertain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs\nprimarily include AI-focused shared R&D activities; corporate initiatives such as our philanthropic activities;\ncorporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and legal costs, including certain fines and\nsettlements. Charges associated with reductions in our workforce and office space announced in January 2023 are\nnot allocated to our segments. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are not allocated to our\nsegments.\nOur operating segments are not evaluated using asset information.\n31",

An overall increase in data center and other operations costs\nwas partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in estimated useful lives of our\nservers and certain network equipment.\n\u2022 Operating expenses were $20.9 billion, an increase of 4% year over year, primarily driven by an increase in\ncompensation expenses largely due to headcount growth, partially offset by a reduction in valuation-based\ncompensation liabilities related to certain Other Bets.

We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP\npercentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for\nfinancial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe\nthe presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to\nunderstand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of\nour core operating results.\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant\nperiod over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency\nexchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated\nlevel. We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a\nyear-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior\nyear comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.\nConstant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period\nrevenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are\ntranslated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of\nboth periods.\nThese results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with\nGAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled\nmeasures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\n40",

Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services\nthat have not yet been recognized as revenue. The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue recognition for\nthese commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when\nour customers utilize services. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over\nthe next 24 months with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred\nrevenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with\nan original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.\nDeferred Revenues\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance,\nincluding amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google\nsubscriptions, platforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2023 was $5.0 billion, of which\n$2.9 billion was recognized as revenues during the six months ended June 30, 2024.\nNote 3. Financial Instruments\nFair Value Measurements\nInvestments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable equity securities are measured at fair value and classified within\nLevel 1 and Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets\n12",

These decreases were partially offset by an increase in AdSense revenues.\nMonetization Metrics\nThe following table presents changes in monetization metrics for Google Search & other revenues (paid clicks\nand cost-per-click) and Google Network revenues (impressions and cost-per-impression), expressed as a\npercentage, from three and six months ended June 30, 2024 to three and six months ended June 30, 2025:\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJune 30, 2025 June 30, 2025\nGoogle Search & other\nPaid clicks change 4 % 3 %\nCost-per-click change 8 % 8 %\nGoogle Network\nImpressions change (6)% (5) %\nCost-per-impression change 6 % 5 %\nChanges in paid clicks and impressions are driven by a number of interrelated factors, including changes in\nadvertiser spending; ongoing product and policy changes; and, as it relates to paid clicks, fluctuations in search\nqueries resulting from changes in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices.\nChanges in cost-per-click and cost-per-impression are driven by a number of interrelated factors including\nchanges in device mix, geographic mix, advertiser spending, ongoing product and policy changes, product mix,\nproperty mix, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues increased $1.9 billion and $3.5 billion from the three\nand six months ended June 30, 2024 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2025.

We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP\npercentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for\nfinancial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe\nthe presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to\nunderstand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of\nour core operating results.\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant\nperiod over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency\nexchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated\nlevel. We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a\nyear-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior\nyear comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.\nConstant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period\nrevenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are\ntranslated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of\nboth periods.\nThese results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with\nGAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled\nmeasures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\n43",

Information about Segments and Geographic Areas\nWe report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:\n\u2022 Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Google Maps,\nGoogle Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales\nof apps and in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-\nbased products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV.\n\u2022 Google Cloud includes Google\u2019s infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services\nfor enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues from fees received for Google Cloud Platform\nservices, Google Workspace collaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\n\u2022 Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues\nfrom Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\nRevenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering\nactivities, and hardware, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the\nintegrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are\nmanaged centrally at a consolidated level. The associated costs, including depreciation and impairment, are\nallocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage or headcount.\nUnallocated corporate costs primarily include corporate initiatives, corporate shared costs, such as finance and\nlegal, including certain fines and settlements, as well as costs associated with certain shared R&D activities.\nAdditionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are included in corporate costs.\nOur operating segments are not evaluated using asset information.\nThe following table presents information about our segments (in millions):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2021 2022 2021 2022\nRevenues:\nGoogle Services $ 59,884 $ 61,377 $ 168,129 $ 185,690\nGoogle Cloud 4,990 6,868 13,665 18,965\nOther Bets 182 209 572 842\nHedging gains (losses) 62 638 (54) 1,291\nTotal revenues $ 65,118 $ 69,092 $ 182,312 $ 206,788\n32",

We report Google in two segments,\nGoogle Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Other\nBets include earlier stage technologies that are further afield from our core Google business. For further details on\nour segments, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q.\nSeasonality and other\nOur advertising revenues are affected by seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and\nunderlying business trends, such as traditional retail seasonality. Additionally, our non-advertising revenues,\nincluding those generated from Google Cloud, Google Play, hardware, and YouTube, may be affected by\nfluctuations driven by changes in pricing, digital content releases, fee structures, new product and service launches,\nand other market dynamics, as well as seasonality.\nRevenues and Monetization Metrics\nGoogle Services\nGoogle Services revenues consist of revenues generated from advertising (\u201cGoogle advertising\u201d) as well as\nrevenues from other sources (\u201cGoogle other revenues\u201d).\nGoogle Advertising\nGoogle advertising revenues are comprised of the following:\n\u2022 Google Search & other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including\nrevenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search\nin browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and\nGoogle Play;\n\u2022 YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and\n\u2022 Google Network, which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob,\nAdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\nWe use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our\nadvertising revenues: paid clicks and cost-per-click pertain to traffic on Google Search & other properties, while\nimpressions and cost-per-impressions pertain to traffic on our Network partners\u2019 properties.\nPaid clicks represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users on Google\nsearch properties and other Google owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google\nPlay. Cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the\naverage amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.\nImpressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in\nAdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based\nrevenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for\neach impression displayed to users.\nAs our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring,\ngathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues\ngenerated by the corresponding click and impression activity.\nOur advertising revenue growth, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search &\nother properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties and the\ncorrelation between these items, have been affected and may continue to be affected by various factors, including:\n\u2022 advertiser competition for keywords;\n34",

We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues and non-GAAP percentage change in constant\ncurrency revenues for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period\ncomparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps\nimprove the ability to understand our performance because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that\nare not indicative of our core operating results.\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant\nperiod over period. We define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the effect of foreign\nexchange rate movements and hedging activities, and use it to determine the constant currency revenue\npercentage change on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current\nperiod revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects\nrealized in the current period.\nConstant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period\nrevenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are\ntranslated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of\nboth periods.\nThese results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with\nGAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled\nmeasures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\n40",

The amount and timing of revenue recognition for these\ncommitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our\ncustomers utilize services, which could affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when we expect to recognize\nsuch as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24\nmonths with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue\ncurrently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original\nexpected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.\nDeferred Revenues\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance,\nincluding amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other.\nTotal deferred revenue as of December 31, 2022 was $4.5 billion, of which $2.3 billion was recognized as revenues\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n12",

Information about Segments and Geographic Areas\nWe report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:\n\u2022 Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Google Maps,\nGoogle Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales\nof apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products such as\nYouTube Premium and YouTube TV.\n\u2022 Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for\nenterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues from fees received for Google Cloud Platform\nservices, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\n\u2022 Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues\nfrom Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\nRevenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering\nactivities, and hardware, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the\nintegrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are\nmanaged centrally at a consolidated level. These costs, including the associated depreciation and impairment, are\nallocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage, headcount, or revenue.\nReflecting DeepMind's increasing collaboration with Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets,\nbeginning in the first quarter of 2023 DeepMind is reported as part of Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs instead\nof within Other Bets. Additionally, beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we updated and simplified our cost allocation\nmethodologies to provide our business leaders with increased transparency for decision-making. Prior periods have\nbeen recast to conform to the current presentation.\nAs announced on April 20, 2023, we brought together part of Google Research (the Brain team) and DeepMind\nto significantly accelerate our progress in artificial intelligence (AI). The group, called Google DeepMind, is reported\nwithin Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs prospectively beginning in the second quarter of 2023. Previously, the\nBrain team was included within Google Services.\nCertain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs\nprimarily include AI-focused shared R&D activities; corporate initiatives such as our philanthropic activities;\ncorporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and legal costs, including certain fines and\nsettlements. Charges associated with reductions in our workforce and office space announced in January 2023 are\nnot allocated to our segments. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are not allocated to our\nsegments.\nOur operating segments are not evaluated using asset information.\n32",

An overall increase in data center and other operations costs was\npartially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in the estimated useful lives of our\nservers and certain network equipment.\n\u2022 Operating expenses were $22.1 billion, an increase of 6% year over year, primarily driven by increases in\ncompensation expenses largely due to an increase in stock-based compensation, and charges related to\nlegal matters, partially offset by a decrease in advertising and promotional activities. Additionally, operating\nexpenses benefited from a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in the estimated useful\nlives of our servers and certain network equipment.\nOther Information\n\u2022 In January 2023, we announced a reduction of our workforce, and as a result we recorded employee\nseverance and related charges of $86 million and $2.1 billion for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, respectively. In addition, we are taking actions to optimize our global office space. As\na result, exit charges recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were $16\nmillion and $649 million, respectively.

We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP\npercentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for\nfinancial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe\nthe presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to\nunderstand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of\nour core operating results.\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant\nperiod over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency\nexchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated\nlevel. We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a\nyear-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior\nyear comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.\nConstant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period\nrevenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are\ntranslated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of\nboth periods.\nThese results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with\nGAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled\nmeasures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\n41",

We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP\npercentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for\nfinancial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe\nthe presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to\nunderstand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of\nour core operating results.\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant\nperiod over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency\nexchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated\nlevel. We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a\nyear-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior\nyear comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.\nConstant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period\nrevenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are\ntranslated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of\nboth periods.\nThese results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with\nGAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled\nmeasures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\n39",

The TAC rate on Google Search &\nother revenues increased from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024 primarily due to increases related to mobile searches, which carries higher TAC\nbecause more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points.

The increase in compensation expenses\nwas primarily driven by a $1.0 billion increase in SBC expenses, which reflects the reduction in valuation-based\ncompensation liabilities related to certain Other Bets recognized in the prior year comparable period, partially offset\nby a $554 million decrease in severance and related charges.\n41",
