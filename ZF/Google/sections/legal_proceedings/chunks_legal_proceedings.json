        "text": "Financial filing text section: Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\nAs of December 31, 2023, Alphabet had 182,502 employees. We have work councils and statutory employee\nrepresentation obligations in certain countries, and we are committed to supporting protected labor rights, maintaining\nan open culture, and listening to all employees. Supporting healthy and open dialogue is central to how we work, and\nwe communicate information about the company through multiple internal channels to our employees.\nWhen necessary we contract with businesses around the world to provide specialized services where we do not\nhave appropriate in-house expertise or resources, often in fields that require specialized training like cafe operations,\ncontent moderation, customer support, and physical security. We also contract with temporary staffing agencies when\nwe need to cover short-term leaves, when we have spikes in business needs, or when we need to quickly incubate\nspecial projects. We choose our partners and staffing agencies carefully, and review their compliance with Google\u2019s\nSupplier Code of Conduct. We continually make improvements to promote a respectful and positive working\nenvironment for everyone \u2014 employees, vendors, and temporary staff alike.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to numerous United States (U.S.) federal, state, and local, as well as foreign laws and regulations\ncovering a wide variety of subjects, and the scope of this coverage continues to broaden with continuing new legal and\nregulatory developments in the U.S. and internationally. Like other companies in the technology industry, we face\nincreasingly heightened scrutiny from both U.S. and foreign governments with respect to our compliance with laws and\nregulations. Many of these laws and regulations are evolving and their applicability and scope, as interpreted by the\ncourts, remain uncertain. Particularly with regard to AI; climate change and sustainability; competition; consumer\nprotection; content moderation; data privacy and security; news publications; and reporting on human capital and\ndiversity, we have seen an increase in new and evolving laws and regulations, as well as related enforcement actions\nand investigations, being proposed and implemented in recent years by legislative and regulatory bodies around the\nworld.\nOur compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and could, individually or in the aggregate,\nincrease our cost of doing business, make our products and services less useful, limit our ability to pursue certain\nbusiness models, cause us to change our business practices, affect our competitive position relative to our peers, and/\nor otherwise harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nFor additional information about government regulation applicable to our business, see Item 1A Risk Factors;\nTrends in Our Business and Financial Effect in Part II, Item 7; and Legal Matters in Note 10 of the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on various intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our\nproprietary technology and our brand. We have registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international\ntrademarks, service marks, domain names, and copyrights. We have also filed patent applications in the U.S. and\nforeign countries covering certain of our technology, and acquired patent assets to supplement our portfolio. We have\nlicensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our rights to other parties. For additional\ninformation, see Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAvailable Information\nOur website is located at www.abc.xyz, and our investor relations website is located at www.abc.xyz/investor.\nAccess to our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and our\nProxy Statements, and any amendments to these reports, is available on our investor relations website, free of charge,\nafter we file or furnish them with the SEC and they are available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.\nWe webcast via our investor relations website our earnings calls and certain events we participate in or host with\nmembers of the investment community. Our investor relations website also provides notifications of news or\nannouncements regarding our financial performance and other items that may be material or of interest to our\ninvestors, including SEC filings, investor events, press and earnings releases, and blogs.

Further, certain of our costs and expenses are generally less variable in nature and\nmay not correlate to changes in revenue. We may also not be able to execute our efforts to re-engineer our cost base\nsuccessfully or in a timely manner. Due to these factors and the evolving nature of our business, our historical revenue\ngrowth rate and historical operating margin may not be indicative of our future performance. For additional information,\nsee Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect and Revenues and Monetization Metrics in Part II, Item 7 of this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of\nour products, services, and brands as well as affect our ability to compete.\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for\nus. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products,\nservices, and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country\nin which our products and services are distributed or made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have\ntaken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Although we seek to obtain patent protection\nfor our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Moreover, we may not have\nadequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. There is always the\npossibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or\nunenforceable.\nWe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy of such trade secrets and\nother sensitive information could be compromised, which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting\nfrom these trade secrets. We also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word\n\u201cGoogle\u201d could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word \u201csearch.\u201d Some courts have\nruled that \"Google\" is a protectable trademark, but it is possible that other courts, particularly those outside of the U.S.,\nmay reach a different determination. If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in\nother people using the word \u201cGoogle\u201d to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand.\nAny significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete.\nAlso, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of\nour intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our financial condition and operating\nresults.\nOur business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our\nability to expand our base of users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners.\nOur strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the\nbrands within Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch\nnew and innovative products and services that better serve the needs of our users, advertisers, customers, content\nproviders, and other partners. Our brands have been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by a number of\nfactors, including, among others, reputational issues, third-party content shared on our platforms, data privacy and\nsecurity issues and developments, and product or technical performance failures. For example, if we fail to respond\nappropriately to the sharing of misinformation or objectionable content on our services and/or products or objectionable\npractices by advertisers, or otherwise to adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence in our\nbrands.\nFurthermore, failure to maintain and enhance our brands could harm our business, reputation, financial condition,\nand operating results. Our success will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to\nprovide high-quality, trustworthy, innovative products and services that are truly useful and play a valuable role in a\nrange of settings.\nWe face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that could harm our business, financial\ncondition, and operating results.\nWe face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management, which could affect our ability\nto supply both our products and our services.\nWe rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture or assemble our devices and servers and networking\nequipment used in our technical infrastructure, and we may supply the contract manufacturers with components to\nassemble the devices and equipment. We also rely on other companies to participate in the supply of components and\ndistribution of our products and services. Our business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage these\ncompanies with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage fail to meet their\n13.",

There is also no guarantee that a series of related issues may not be determined to be material at a\nlater date in the aggregate, even if they may not be material individually at the time of their occurrence. Because the\ntechniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, disable or degrade service provided by or otherwise sabotage\nsystems change frequently and often are recognized only after being launched against a target, even taking all\nreasonable precautions, including those required by law, we have been unable in the past and may continue to be\nunable to anticipate or detect attacks or vulnerabilities or implement adequate preventative measures.\nFurther, if any partners with whom we share user or other customer information fail to implement adequate data-\nsecurity practices, fail to comply with our terms and policies, or otherwise suffer a network or other security breach, our\nusers\u2019 data may be improperly accessed, used, or disclosed. If an actual or perceived breach of our or our business\npartners\u2019 or service providers\u2019 security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures\nwould be harmed, we could lose users and customers, our trade secrets or those of our business partners may be\ncompromised, and we may be exposed to significant legal and financial risks, including legal claims (which may\ninclude class-action litigation) and regulatory actions, fines, and penalties. Any of the foregoing consequences could\nharm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWhile we have dedicated significant resources to privacy and security incident response capabilities, including\ndedicated worldwide incident response teams, our response process, particularly during times of a natural disaster or\npandemic, may not be adequate, may fail to accurately assess the severity of an incident, may not be fast enough to\nprevent or limit harm, or may fail to sufficiently remediate an incident. As a result, we may suffer significant legal,\nreputational, or financial exposure, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nFor additional information, see also our risk factor on privacy and data protection regulations under \u2018Risks Related\nto Laws, Regulations, and Policies\u2019 below.\nOur ongoing investments in safety, security, and content review will likely continue to identify abuse of\nour platforms and misuse of user data.\nIn addition to our efforts to prevent and mitigate cyber attacks, we are making significant investments in safety,\nsecurity, and review efforts to combat misuse of our services and unauthorized access to user data by third parties,\nincluding investigation and review of platform applications that could access the information of users of our services.\nAs a result of these efforts, we have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, incidents of unnecessary\naccess to or misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties. However, we may not have discovered,\nand may in the future not discover, all such incidents or activity, whether as a result of our data limitations, including\nour lack of visibility over our encrypted services, the scale of activity on our platform, or other factors, including factors\noutside of our control such as a natural disaster or pandemic, and we may learn of such incidents or activity via third\nparties. Such incidents and activities may include the use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our\nterms, contracts or policies, the existence of false or undesirable user accounts, election interference, improper ad\npurchases, activities that threaten people\u2019s safety on- or off-line, or instances of spamming, scraping, or spreading\ndisinformation. While we may not determine some of these incidents to be material at the time they occurred and we\nmay remedy them quickly, there is no guarantee that these issues will not ultimately result in significant legal, financial,\nand reputational harm, including government inquiries and enforcement actions, litigation, and negative publicity. There\nis also no guarantee that a series of related issues may not be determined to be material at a later date in the\naggregate, even if they may not be material individually at the time of their occurrence.\nWe may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise prevent or remediate any such\nincidents. Any of the foregoing developments may negatively affect user trust and engagement, harm our reputation\nand brands, require us to change our business practices in ways that harm our business operations, and adversely\naffect our business and financial results. Any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and\nregulatory inquiries, which could result in monetary penalties and damages, divert management\u2019s time and attention,\nand lead to enhanced regulatory oversight.\nProblematic content on our platforms, including low-quality user-generated content, web spam, content\nfarms, and other violations of our guidelines could affect the quality of our services, which could harm our\nreputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services.\nWe, like others in the industry, face violations of our content guidelines across our platforms, including\nsophisticated attempts by bad actors to manipulate our hosting and advertising systems to fraudulently generate\nrevenues, or to otherwise generate traffic that does not represent genuine user interest or intent. While we invest\nsignificantly in efforts to promote high-quality and relevant results and to detect and prevent low-quality content and\ninvalid traffic, we have been unable and may continue to be unable to detect and prevent all such abuses or promote\n17.",

Increased use of AI in our offerings and internal systems may create new avenues of\nabuse for bad actors.\nMany websites violate or attempt to violate our guidelines, including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in\nsearch results than our search engine's assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them. Such efforts have\naffected, and may continue to affect, the quality of content on our platforms and lead them to display false, misleading,\nor undesirable content. Although English-language web spam in our search results has been reduced, and web spam\nin most other languages is limited, we expect web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improve their\nrankings. Although we continue to invest in and deploy proprietary technology to detect and prevent web spam on our\nplatforms, there is no guarantee that our technology will always be successful, and our users may have negative\nexperiences on our platforms if our technology fails to work as intended, which may affect our users' decisions in\ncontinuing to use our platforms. We also face other challenges from low-quality and irrelevant content websites,\nincluding content farms, which are websites that generate large quantities of low-quality content to help them improve\ntheir search rankings. We are continually launching algorithmic changes designed to detect and prevent abuse from\nlow-quality websites, but we may not always be successful. We also face other challenges on our platforms, including\nviolations of our content guidelines involving incidents such as attempted election interference, activities that threaten\nthe safety and/or well-being of our users on- or off-line, and the spreading of misinformation or disinformation.\nIf we fail to either detect and prevent an increase in problematic content or effectively promote high-quality\ncontent, it could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information or reduce use of our platforms, harming our\nfinancial condition and operating results. It may also subject us to litigation and regulatory actions, which could result in\nmonetary penalties and damages and divert management\u2019s time and attention.\nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users. Internet\naccess providers may be able to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and\nservices, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers.\nOur products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet, and certain of our products\nrequire significant bandwidth to work effectively. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant\nmarket power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable\ncompanies, mobile communications companies, and government-owned service providers. Some of these providers\nhave taken, or have stated that they may take, measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user\naccess to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our\nofferings, by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings, or by providing our competitors\npreferential access. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by internet\naccess providers; however, substantial uncertainty exists in the U.S. and elsewhere regarding such protections. For\nexample, in 2018 the U.S. Federal Communications Commission repealed net neutrality rules, which could permit\ninternet access providers to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services. In\naddition, in some jurisdictions, our products and services have been subject to government-initiated restrictions or\nblockages. These could harm existing key relationships, including with our users, customers, advertisers, and/or\ncontent providers, and impair our ability to attract new ones; harm our reputation; and increase costs, thereby\nnegatively affecting our business.\nRisks Related to Laws, Regulations, and Policies\nWe are subject to a variety of new, existing, and changing laws and regulations worldwide that could\nharm our business, and will likely be subject to an even broader scope of laws and regulations as we continue\nto expand our business.\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subjects, and our\nintroduction of new businesses, products, services, and technologies will likely continue to subject us to additional laws\nand regulations. In recent years, governments around the world have proposed and adopted a large number of new\nlaws and regulations relevant to the digital economy, particularly in the areas of data privacy and security, competition,\nenvironmental, social and governance (ESG) requirements, AI, and online content. The costs of compliance with these\nmeasures are high and are likely to increase in the future.\nNew or changing laws and regulations, or new interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a\nmanner inconsistent with our practices, have resulted in, and may continue to result in, less useful products and\nservices, altered business practices, limited ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products and\nservices, substantial costs, and civil or criminal liability. Examples include laws and regulations regarding:\n\u2022 Competition and technology platforms\u2019 business practices: Laws and regulations focused on large\ntechnology platforms, including the Digital Markets Act in the European Union (EU); regulations and legal\n18.",

For example, while\nlegislative text has yet to be finalized and formally approved, provisional political agreement on a proposed EU\nAI Act was reached between co-legislators in December 2023, including that specific transparency and other\nrequirements would be introduced for general purpose AI systems and the models on which those systems are\nbased. In addition, the White House's Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and\nUse of Artificial Intelligence devises a framework for the U.S. government, among other things, to regulate\nprivate sector use and development of certain foundation models.\n\u2022 Data privacy, collection, and processing: Laws and regulations further restricting the collection, processing,\nand/or sharing of user or advertising-related data, including privacy and data protection laws; laws affecting the\nprocessing of children's data (as discussed further below), data breach notification laws, and laws limiting data\ntransfers (including data localization laws).\n\u2022 Copyright and other intellectual property: Copyright and related laws, including the EU Directive on\nCopyright in the Digital Single Market and European Economic Area transpositions, which may introduce new\nlicensing regimes, increase liability with respect to content uploaded by users or linked to from our platforms,\nor create property rights in news publications that could require payments to news agencies and publishers,\nwhich may result in other regulatory actions.\n\u2022 Content moderation: Various laws covering content moderation and removal, and related disclosure\nobligations, such as the EU's Digital Services Act, Florida\u2019s Senate Bill 7072 and Texas\u2019 House Bill 20, and\nlaws and proposed legislation in Singapore, Australia, and the United Kingdom that impose penalties for failure\nto remove certain types of content or require disclosure of information about the operation of our services and\nalgorithms, which may make it harder for services like Google Search and YouTube to detect and deal with\nlow-quality, deceptive, or harmful content.\n\u2022 Consumer protection: Consumer protection laws, including the EU\u2019s New Deal for Consumers, which could\nresult in monetary penalties and create a range of new compliance obligations.\nIn addition, the applicability and scope of these and other laws and regulations, as interpreted by courts,\nregulators, or administrative bodies, remain uncertain and could be interpreted in ways that harm our business. For\nexample, we rely on statutory safe harbors, like those set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Section 230\nof the Communications Decency Act in the U.S. and the E-Commerce Directive in Europe, to protect against liability for\nvarious linking, caching, ranking, recommending, and hosting activities. Legislation or court rulings affecting these safe\nharbors may adversely affect us and may impose significant operational challenges. There are legislative proposals\nand pending litigation in the U.S., EU, and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for\nwebsites and online platforms. Our development, use, and commercialization of AI products and services (including\nour implementation of AI in our offerings and internal systems) could subject us to regulatory action and legal liability,\nincluding under specific legislation regulating AI, as well as new applications of existing data protection, cybersecurity,\nprivacy, intellectual property, and other laws.\nWe are and may continue to be subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations,\nenforcement actions, consent orders, and other forms of regulatory scrutiny and legal liability that could harm\nour business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and orders\ninvolving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and\nemployment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or\npublishers using our platforms, personal injury, and other matters. We are also subject to a variety of claims including\nproduct warranty, product liability, and consumer protection claims related to product defects, among other litigation,\nand we may also be subject to claims involving health and safety, hazardous materials usage, other environmental\neffects, AI training, development, and commercialization, or service disruptions or failures. Claims have been brought,\nand we expect will continue to be brought, against us for defamation, negligence, breaches of contract, copyright and\ntrademark infringement, unfair competition, unlawful activity, torts, privacy rights violations, fraud, or other legal\ntheories based on the nature and content of information available on or via our services, the design and effect of our\nproducts and services, or due to our involvement in hosting, transmitting, marketing, branding, or providing access to\ncontent created by third parties.\n19.",

We plan to appeal. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice,\nvarious U.S. states, and other plaintiffs have filed several antitrust lawsuits about various aspects of our business,\nincluding our advertising technologies and practices, the operation and distribution of Google Search, and the\noperation and distribution of the Android operating system and Play Store. Other regulatory agencies in the U.S. and\naround the world, including competition enforcers, consumer protection agencies, and data protection authorities, have\nchallenged and may continue to challenge our business practices and compliance with laws and regulations. We are\ncooperating with these investigations and defending litigation or appealing decisions where appropriate.\nVarious laws, regulations, investigations, enforcement lawsuits, and regulatory actions have involved in the past,\nand may in the future result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing\nobligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models and operations, including\ndivestiture, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which could harm our business,\nreputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nAny of these legal proceedings could result in legal costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity\nand other harms to our business. Estimating liabilities for our pending proceedings is a complex, fact-specific, and\nspeculative process that requires significant judgment, and the amounts we are ultimately liable for may be less than or\nexceed our estimates. The resolution of one or more such proceedings has resulted in, and may in the future result in,\nadditional substantial fines, penalties, injunctions, and other sanctions that could harm our business, reputation,\nfinancial condition, and operating results.\nFor additional information about the ongoing material legal proceedings to which we are subject, see Legal\nProceedings in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPrivacy, data protection, and data usage regulations are complex and rapidly evolving areas. Any failure\nor alleged failure to comply with these laws could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and\noperating results.\nAuthorities around the world have adopted and are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals\nconcerning data protection, data usage, and encryption of user data. Adverse legal rulings, legislation, or regulation\nhave resulted in, and may continue to result in, fines and orders requiring that we change our practices, which have\nhad and could continue to have an adverse effect on how we provide services, harming our business, reputation,\nfinancial condition, and operating results. These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and\ncompliance obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs or harm the quality and operations of our products\nand services in ways that harm our business. Examples of these laws include:\n\u2022 The General Data Protection Regulation and the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulations, which\napply to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or the United Kingdom, respectively, or\nrelated to products and services that we offer to EU or the United Kingdom users or customers, respectively, or\nthe monitoring of their behavior in the EU or the UK, respectively.\n\u2022 Various comprehensive U.S. state and foreign privacy laws, which give new data privacy rights to their\nrespective residents (including, in California, a private right of action in the event of a data breach resulting\nfrom our failure to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices) and impose\nsignificant obligations on controllers and processors of consumer data.\n\u2022 State laws governing the processing of biometric information, such as the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy\nAct and the Texas Capture or Use of Biometric Identifier Act, which impose obligations on businesses that\ncollect or disclose consumer biometric information.\n\u2022 Various federal, state, and foreign laws governing how companies provide age appropriate experiences to\nchildren and minors, including the collection and processing of children and minor\u2019s data. These include the\nChildren\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, and the United Kingdom Age-Appropriate Design Code, all of\nwhich address the use and disclosure of the personal data of children and minors and impose obligations on\nonline services or products directed to or likely to be accessed by children.\n\u2022 The California Internet of Things Security Law, which regulates the security of data used in connection with\ninternet-connected devices.\n\u2022 The EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act, which will require in-scope companies to obtain user consent for combining data\nacross certain products and require search engines to share anonymized data with rival companies, among\nother changes.\n20.",

The validity of various data transfer mechanisms we\ncurrently rely upon remains subject to legal, regulatory, and political developments in both Europe and the U.S., which\nmay require us to adapt our existing arrangements.\nWe face, and may continue to face, intellectual property and other claims that could be costly to defend,\nresult in significant damage awards or other costs (including indemnification awards), and limit our ability to\nuse certain technologies.\nWe, like other internet, technology, and media companies, are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations\nof infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights, including patent, copyright, trade secrets, and\ntrademarks. Parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in U.S. and international courts\nand the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) for exclusion and cease-and-desist orders. In addition, patent-\nholding companies may frequently seek to generate income from patents they have obtained by bringing claims\nagainst us. As we continue to expand our business, the number of intellectual property claims against us has increased\nand may continue to increase as we develop and acquire new products, services, and technologies.\nAdverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing\nagreements (if licenses are available at all), or orders limiting our ability to sell our products and services in the U.S. or\nelsewhere, including by preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services in certain\njurisdictions. They may also cause us to change our business practices in ways that could result in a loss of revenues\nfor us and otherwise harm our business.\nMany of our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require us to defend\nagainst certain intellectual property infringement claims and in some cases indemnify them for certain intellectual\nproperty infringement claims against them, which could result in increased costs for defending such claims or\nsignificant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Such customers and partners may also\ndiscontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could\nresult in loss of revenues and harm our business. Moreover, intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our\nsuppliers, when obtainable, may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers arising from\nintellectual property infringement claims. Furthermore, in connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in\nthe future agree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, including those associated with intellectual\nproperty claims. Regardless of their merits, intellectual property claims are often time consuming and expensive to\nlitigate or settle. To the extent such claims are successful, they could harm our business, including our product and\nservice offerings, financial condition, and operating results.\nExpectations relating to ESG considerations could expose us to potential liabilities, increased costs, and\nreputational harm.\nWe are subject to laws, regulations, and other measures that govern a wide range of topics, including those\nrelated to matters beyond our core products and services. For instance, new laws, regulations, policies, and\ninternational accords relating to ESG matters, including sustainability, climate change, human capital, and diversity, are\nbeing developed and formalized in Europe, the U.S., and elsewhere, which may entail specific, target-driven\nframeworks and/or disclosure requirements. We have implemented robust ESG programs, adopted reporting\nframeworks and principles, and announced a number of goals and initiatives. The implementation of these goals and\ninitiatives may require considerable investments, and our goals, with all of their contingencies, dependencies, and in\ncertain cases, reliance on third-party verification and/or performance, are complex and ambitious, and may change.\nWe cannot guarantee that our goals and initiatives will be fully realized on the timelines we expect or at all, and\nprojects that are completed as planned may not achieve the results we anticipate. Any failure, or perceived failure, by\nus to adhere to our public statements, comply fully with developing interpretations of ESG laws and regulations, or\nmeet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could harm our business, reputation, financial\ncondition, and operating results.\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or\nexposure to additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions.\nOur effective tax rates are affected by a variety of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with\ndifferent statutory tax rates, net gains and losses on hedges and related transactions under our foreign exchange risk\nmanagement program, changes in our stock price for shares issued as employee compensation, changes in the\nvaluation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, and the application of different provisions of tax laws or changes in tax\nlaws, regulations, or accounting principles (including changes in the interpretation of existing laws).

These provisions may discourage or deter\na potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer's own slate of directors or\notherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.\n\u2022 Our Board of Directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock,\nwhich makes it possible for our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or\npreferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware\nlaw, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its outstanding voting\nstock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the Board of Directors has approved\nthe transaction. Our Board of Directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.\nThe trading price for our Class A stock and non-voting Class C stock may continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our stock has at times experienced significant volatility and may continue to be volatile. In\naddition to the factors discussed in this report, the trading prices of our Class A stock and Class C stock have\nfluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate widely, in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control,\nincluding, among others, the activities of our peers and changes in broader economic and political conditions around\nthe world. These broad market and industry factors could harm the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C\nstock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nGeneral Risks\nOur operating results may fluctuate, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our\nresults to fall short of expectations.\nOur operating results have fluctuated, and may in the future fluctuate, as a result of a number of factors, many\noutside of our control, including the cyclical nature and seasonality in our business and geopolitical events. As a result,\ncomparing our operating results (including our expenses as a percentage of our revenues) on a period-to-period basis\nmay not be meaningful, and our past results should not be relied on as an indication of our future performance.\nConsequently, our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations.\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures could result in operating difficulties, dilution,\nand other consequences that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures are important elements of our overall corporate strategy\nand use of capital, and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and operating results. We expect\nto continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of such potential strategic arrangements,\nwhich could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Some of the areas where we face risks include:\n\u2022 diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and\nother strategic arrangements;\n\u2022 failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities, or conditions\nplaced upon approval that could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or\notherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of a transaction;\n\u2022 failure to successfully integrate the acquired operations, technologies, services, and personnel (including\ncultural integration and retention of employees) and further develop the acquired business or technology;\n\u2022 implementation of controls (or remediation of control deficiencies), procedures, and policies at the acquired\ncompany;\n\u2022 integration of the acquired company\u2019s accounting and other administrative systems, and the coordination of\nproduct, engineering, and sales and marketing functions;\n\u2022 transition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms;\n\u2022 in the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages\nand to address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific\ncountries;\n\u2022 failure to accomplish commercial, strategic or financial objectives with respect to investments, joint ventures,\nand other strategic arrangements;\n\u2022 failure to realize the value of investments and joint ventures due to a lack of liquidity;\n23.",

In\nconnection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to provide indemnification for certain\npotential liabilities, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nWe rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire\nqualified personnel, or maintain and continue to adapt our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow or\noperate effectively.\nOur performance and future success depends in large part upon the continued service of key technical leads as\nwell as members of our senior management team.

In addition, our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be\nsuccessful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Restrictive immigration\npolicy and regulatory changes may also affect our ability to hire, mobilize, or retain some of our global talent.

The EC decision imposed a \u20ac2.4\nbillion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision to the General\nCourt, and on September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into compliance with the\nEC's decision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2017. On November 10,\n2021, the General Court rejected our appeal, and we subsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice\non January 20, 2022.\nOn July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google\u2019s Android-related distribution\nagreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a \u20ac4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30,\n2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision, and\non October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution practices. On September 14,\n2022, the General Court reduced the fine from \u20ac4.3 billion to \u20ac4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal with the\nEuropean Court of Justice. In 2018, we recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by\n$217 million in 2022.\nOn March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that Google\nhad with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a fine of \u20ac1.5\nbillion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners' agreements,\nwhich we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed the EC decision. We recognized a charge\nof $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019.\nFrom time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on various competition\nmatters by regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally. Examples, for which given their\nnature we cannot estimate a possible loss, include:\n\u2022 In August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)\nrequesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our\nbusiness. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the\nDistrict of Columbia on October 20, 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search\nand Search advertising. The trial ended on November 16, 2023, and we expect a decision in 2024. Further, in\nJune 2022, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the United Kingdom's\nCompetition and Markets Authority (CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\n\u2022 On December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state\ndeceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology, and a trial is scheduled for March 2025. Additionally,\non January 24, 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state Attorneys General, filed an antitrust complaint in\nthe U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging that Google\u2019s digital advertising technology\nproducts violate U.S. antitrust laws, and on April 17, 2023, a number of additional state Attorneys General\njoined the complaint. The EC, the CMA, and the ACCC each opened a formal investigation into Google's\nadvertising technology business practices on June 22, 2021, May 25, 2022, and June 29, 2022, respectively.\nOn June 14, 2023, the EC issued a Statement of Objections (SO) informing Google of its preliminary view that\nGoogle violated European antitrust laws relating to its advertising technology. We responded to the SO on\nDecember 1, 2023.\n\u2022 On July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for\nthe Northern District of California, alleging that Google\u2019s operation of Android and Google Play violated U.S.\nantitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In September 2023, we reached a settlement\nin principle with 50 state Attorneys General and three territories. The U.S. District Court subsequently vacated\nthe trial date with the states, and any final approval of the settlement is expected to occur in 2024. In May\n2022, the EC and the CMA each opened investigations into Google Play\u2019s business practices. Korean\nregulators are investigating Google Play's billing practices, including a formal review in May 2022 of Google's\ncompliance with the new app store billing regulations.\nWe believe we have strong arguments against these claims and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue to\ncooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\n78.",

For example, there are ongoing investigations and\nlitigation in the U.S. and the EU, including those relating to our collection and use of location information and\nadvertising practices, which could result in significant fines, judgments, and product changes.\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these\nlawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders\npreventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change\nour business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for\nus and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly\nbecome an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can\nresult in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a\nprohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important\nproducts into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against\ncertain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims,\nand may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our\ncustomers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions\nor otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\nOther\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent\norders involving competition, intellectual property, data security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment,\ncommercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using\nour platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, in December 2023, a California\njury delivered a verdict in Epic Games v. Google finding that Google violated antitrust laws related to Google Play's\nbusiness. The presiding judge will determine remedies in 2024, and the range of potential remedies vary widely. We\nplan to appeal. We also periodically have data incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law.\nThese claims, consent orders, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings could\nresult in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our\nproducts and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other\nadverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, civil judgments that include compounding\npenalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including\nthose of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.\nNon-Income Taxes\nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The\nsubject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the\nsale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We accrue\nnon-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when\na loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of\nloss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of\nthese matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially different from our\nexpectations.\nSee, Note 14 for information regarding income tax contingencies.\n79.",

BUSINESS\nOverview\nAs our founders Larry and Sergey wrote in the original founders' letter, \"Google is not a conventional company.\nWe do not intend to become one.\" That unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history, inspiring\nus to tackle big problems and invest in moonshots. It led us to be a pioneer in the development of AI and, since 2016,\nan AI-first company. We continue this work under the leadership of Alphabet and Google CEO, Sundar Pichai.\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses \u2014 the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments,\nGoogle Services and Google Cloud, and all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Supporting these\nbusinesses, we have centralized certain AI-related research and development which is reported in Alphabet-level\nactivities. Alphabet's structure is about helping each of our businesses prosper through strong leaders and\nindependence.\nAccess and Technology for Everyone\nThe Internet is one of the world\u2019s most powerful equalizers; it propels ideas, people, and businesses large and\nsmall. Our mission to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant\ntoday as it was when we were founded in 1998. Since then, we have evolved from a company that helps people find\nanswers to a company that also helps people get things done.\nWe are focused on building an even more helpful Google for everyone, and we aspire to give everyone the tools\nthey need to increase their knowledge, health, happiness, and success. Google Search helps people find information\nand make sense of the world in more natural and intuitive ways, with trillions of searches on Google every year.\nYouTube provides people with entertainment, information, and opportunities to learn something new and helps support\nthe creator economy through the YouTube Partner Program. Google Cloud helps customers solve today\u2019s business\nchallenges, improve productivity, reduce costs, and unlock new growth engines. We are continually innovating and\nbuilding new products and features to help our users, partners, customers, and communities and have invested more\nthan $150 billion in research and development in the last five years in support of these efforts.\n4.",

Many of these laws and regulations are evolving and their applicability and scope, as interpreted by the\ncourts, remain uncertain. Particularly with regard to AI; competition; consumer protection; content moderation; data\nprivacy and security; news publications; and sustainability and other social matters, we have seen an increase in new\nand evolving laws and regulations, as well as related enforcement actions and investigations, being proposed and\nimplemented in recent years by legislative and regulatory bodies around the world. As we have seen in recent years,\ndifferent laws and regulations on the same topic may not always have the same requirements, and even when\nrequirements overlap, the rules are not always consistently implemented, interpreted, and enforced from jurisdiction to\njurisdiction.\nOur compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and could, individually or in the aggregate,\nincrease our cost of doing business, make our products and services less useful, limit our ability to pursue certain\nbusiness practices or offer certain products and services, cause us to change our business models and operations,\naffect our competitive position relative to our peers, and/or otherwise harm our business, reputation, financial condition,\nand operating results.\nFor additional information about government regulation applicable to our business, see Item 1A Risk Factors;\nTrends in Our Business and Financial Effect in Part II, Item 7; and Legal Matters in Note 10 of the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on various intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our\nproprietary technology and our brand.

We have also filed patent applications in the U.S. and\nforeign countries covering certain of our technology, and acquired patent assets to supplement our portfolio. We have\nlicensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our rights to other parties.

Reduced spending by advertisers, a\nloss of partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to personalize\nads could harm our business.\nWe generated more than 75% of total revenues from online advertising in 2024. Many of our advertisers,\ncompanies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their\ncontracts with us at any time. These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value\n(such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more effective\n10.",

Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practices, such as\nour initiatives related to third-party cookies, including our announcement in July 2024 to move from phasing out all\nthird-party cookies to a proposed user choice model (which remains subject to continuing discussions with regulators),\nas well as changes to other companies\u2019 advertising and/or data privacy practices have in the past, and may in the\nfuture, affect the advertising services that we are able to provide. In addition, technologies have been developed that\nmake personalized ads more difficult, or that block the display of ads altogether, and some providers of online services\nhave integrated technologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of third-party digital\nadvertising. Failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively and competitively could harm our\nbusiness, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions. Adverse\nmacroeconomic conditions have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in\nfluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and\noperating results.\nWe face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that\nare useful to users, customers, and other partners, we may not remain competitive, which could harm our\nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. Our businesses face changing\ntechnologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete successfully,\nwe must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful products, services,\nand technologies in a timely manner. As our businesses evolve, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a\nwider range of products and services. We must continue to invest significant resources in technical infrastructure and\nR&D, including through acquisitions, in order to enhance our technology, products, and services.\nWe have many competitors in different industries. Our current and potential domestic and international\ncompetitors range from large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Some competitors have longer\noperating histories and well-established relationships in various sectors. They can use their experience and resources\nin ways that could affect our competitive position, including by making acquisitions and entering into other strategic\narrangements; continuing to invest heavily in technical infrastructure, R&D, and in talent; initiating intellectual property\nand competition claims (whether or not meritorious); and continuing to compete for users, advertisers, customers, and\ncontent providers. Further, discrepancies in enforcement of existing laws may enable our lesser known competitors to\naggressively interpret those laws without commensurate scrutiny, thereby affording them competitive advantages. Our\ncompetitors may also be able to innovate and provide products and services faster or more cost effectively than we\ncan or may foresee the need for products and services before we do.\nWe are expanding our investment in AI across the entire company. This includes generative AI and continuing to\nintegrate AI capabilities into our products and services. AI technology and services are highly competitive, rapidly\nevolving, and require significant investment, including technical infrastructure, development and operational costs, to\nmeet the changing needs and expectations of our existing users and attract new users. Our ability to deploy certain AI\ntechnologies critical for our products and services and for our business strategy may depend on the availability and\npricing of third-party equipment and other technical infrastructure operations costs, including network capacity, energy,\nand equipment costs. Additionally, other companies may develop AI products and technologies that are similar or\nsuperior to our technologies or more cost-effective to develop and/or deploy. Other companies may also have (or in the\nfuture may obtain) patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit, or interfere with our ability to make, use,\nor sell our own AI products and services.\nOur financial condition and operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive in a\ntimely manner to the evolving needs and desires of our users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content\nproviders, or if we miscalculate those needs and desires and invest significantly in areas that fail to gain sufficient\nmarket traction. As new and existing technologies continue to develop, competitors and new entrants may be able to\noffer experiences that are, or that are perceived to be, substantially similar to or better than ours. These technologies\ncould reduce usage of our products and services, and force us to compete in different ways and expend significant\nresources to develop and operate equal or better products and services. Competitors\u2019 success in providing compelling\nproducts and services or in attracting and retaining users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers\ncould harm our financial condition and operating results.\nOur ongoing investment in new businesses, products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and\ncould divert management attention and harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services, and technologies in a\nwide range of industries beyond online advertising.

Further, certain of our\ncosts and expenses are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. We may also\nnot be able to continue to execute our efficiency efforts successfully or in a timely manner. Due to these factors and the\nevolving nature of our business, our historical revenue growth rate and historical operating margin may not be\nindicative of our future performance. For additional information, see Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect and\nRevenues and Monetization Metrics in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of\nour products, services, and brands as well as affect our ability to compete.\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for\nus. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products,\nservices, and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country\nin which our products and services are distributed or made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have\ntaken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Although we seek to obtain patent protection\nfor our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Moreover, we may not have\nadequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. There is always the\npossibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or\nunenforceable.\nWe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy of such trade secrets and\nother sensitive information could be compromised, which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting\nfrom these trade secrets. We also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word\n\u201cGoogle\u201d could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word \u201csearch.\u201d Some courts have\nruled that \"Google\" is a protectable trademark, but it is possible that other courts, particularly those outside of the U.S.,\nmay reach a different determination. If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in\nother people using the word \u201cGoogle\u201d to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand.\nAny significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete.\nAlso, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of\nour intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our financial condition and operating\nresults.\nOur business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our\nability to expand our base of users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners.\nOur strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the\nbrands within Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch\nnew and innovative products and services that better serve the needs of our users, advertisers, customers, content\nproviders, and other partners. Our brands have been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by a number of\nfactors, including, among others, reputational issues, third-party content shared on our platforms, data privacy and\nsecurity issues and developments, and product or technical performance failures. For example, if we fail to respond\nappropriately to the sharing of misinformation or objectionable content on our services and/or products or objectionable\npractices by advertisers, or otherwise to adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence in our\nbrands.\nFurthermore, failure to maintain and enhance our brands could harm our business, reputation, financial condition,\nand operating results. Our success will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to\nprovide high-quality, trustworthy, innovative products and services that are truly useful and play a valuable role in a\nrange of settings.\nWe face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that could harm our business, financial\ncondition, and operating results.\nWe face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management, which could affect our ability\nto supply both our products and our services.\nWe rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture or assemble our devices as well as servers and networking\nequipment used in our technical infrastructure, certain components of which we may supply. We rely on third parties to\nsupply components and distribute our products and services. Our business could be negatively affected if we are not\nable to engage these companies with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we\nengage fail to meet their obligations (whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons), or make adverse changes\nin the pricing or other material terms of our arrangements with them.\n13.",

While we invest\nsignificantly in efforts to promote high-quality and relevant results and to detect and prevent low-quality content and\ninvalid traffic, we have been unable and may continue to be unable to detect and prevent all such abuses or promote\nuniformly high-quality content. Increased use of AI in our offerings and internal systems may create new avenues of\nabuse for bad actors.\nMany websites violate or attempt to violate our guidelines, including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in\nsearch results than our search engine's assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them. Such efforts have\naffected, and may continue to affect, the quality of content on our platforms and lead them to display false, misleading,\nor undesirable content. Although English-language web spam in our search results has been reduced, and web spam\nin most other languages is limited, we expect web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improve their\nrankings. Although we continue to invest in and deploy proprietary technology to detect and prevent web spam on our\nplatforms, there is no guarantee that our technology will always be successful, and our users may have negative\nexperiences on our platforms if our technology fails to work as intended, which may affect our users' decisions in\ncontinuing to use our platforms. We also face other challenges from low-quality and irrelevant content websites,\nincluding content farms, which are websites that generate large quantities of low-quality content to help them improve\ntheir search rankings. We are continually launching algorithmic changes designed to detect and prevent abuse from\nlow-quality websites, but we may not always be successful. We also face other challenges on our platforms, including\nviolations of our content guidelines involving incidents such as attempted election interference; activities that threaten\nthe safety and/or well-being of our users, including minors, on- or off-line; and the spreading of misinformation or\ndisinformation.\nIf we fail to either detect and prevent an increase in problematic content or effectively promote high-quality\ncontent, it could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information or reduce use of our platforms, harming our\nfinancial condition and operating results. It may also subject us to litigation and regulatory actions, which could result in\nmonetary penalties and damages and divert management\u2019s time and attention.\nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users. Internet\naccess providers may be able to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and\nservices, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers.\nOur products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet, and certain of our products\nrequire significant network capacity to work effectively. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have\nsignificant market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone\ncompanies, cable companies, mobile communications companies, and government-owned service providers. Some of\nthese providers have taken, or have stated that they may take, measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the\ncost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or\nfacilitate our offerings, by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings, or by providing our\ncompetitors preferential access. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination\nby internet access providers; however, substantial uncertainty exists in the U.S. and elsewhere regarding such\nprotections. In addition, in some jurisdictions, our products and services have been subject to government-initiated\nrestrictions or blockages. These could harm existing key relationships, including with our users, customers,\nadvertisers, and/or content providers, and impair our ability to attract new ones; harm our reputation; and increase\ncosts, thereby negatively affecting our business.\nRisks Related to Laws, Regulations, and Policies\nWe are subject to a variety of new, existing, and changing laws and regulations worldwide that could\nharm our business, and will likely be subject to an even broader scope of laws and regulations as we continue\nto expand our business.\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state as well as foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety\nof subjects, and our introduction of new businesses, products, services, and technologies will likely continue to subject\nus to additional laws and regulations. In recent years, governments around the world have proposed and adopted a\nlarge number of new laws and regulations relevant to the digital economy, particularly in the areas of data privacy and\nsecurity, competition, AI, and online content. The costs of compliance with these measures are high and are likely to\nincrease in the future, including as a result of differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws and regulations.\n18.",

The EU AI Act\nintroduces various requirements for AI systems and models placed on the market or put into service in the EU,\nincluding specific transparency and other requirements for general purpose AI systems and the models on\nwhich those systems are based. In the U.S., there is increasing uncertainty as to the federal government's\napproach to AI regulation going forward, as the continued applicability of the White House's 2023 Executive\nOrder on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence, which lays out a\nframework for the U.S. government, among other things, to monitor private sector development of certain\nfoundation models, remains subject to regulatory development. Several states are considering enacting or\nhave already enacted regulations concerning the use of AI technologies, including those focused on consumer\nprotection, and depending on the scope of AI regulation at the federal level, some states may move to regulate\nAI model development and deployment. Further, at the federal and state level, there have been various\nproposals (and in some cases laws enacted) addressing \u201cdeepfakes\u201d and other AI-generated synthetic media.\n\u2022 Data privacy, collection, processing, and portability: Laws and regulations further restricting the collection,\nprocessing, and/or sharing of user or advertising-related data, including privacy and data protection laws; laws\naffecting the processing of children's data (as discussed further below), data breach notification laws; laws\nlimiting data transfers (including data localization laws); and laws requiring data portability (including the EU\nData Act, as discussed further below).\n\u2022 Copyright and other intellectual property: Copyright and related laws, including the EU Directive on\nCopyright in the Digital Single Market and European Economic Area transpositions, which have introduced\nnew licensing regimes, increase liability with respect to content uploaded by users or linked to from our\nplatforms, or create property rights in news publications that could require payments to news agencies and\npublishers, which may result in other regulatory actions.\n\u2022 Content moderation: Various laws covering content moderation and removal, and related disclosure\nobligations, such as the EU's Digital Services Act, Florida\u2019s Senate Bill 7072 and Texas\u2019 House Bill 20, and\nlaws and proposed legislation in Singapore, Australia, and the United Kingdom that impose penalties for failure\nto remove certain types of content or require disclosure of information about the operation of our services and\nalgorithms, which may make it harder for services like Google Search and YouTube to detect and deal with\nlow-quality, deceptive, or harmful content, or on the other hand, may impinge on the rights of free expression,\nwhich, in turn, could impact how our platforms are viewed by users. Additionally, legislators are increasingly\nfocused on regulating online child safety, including content protections for minors under eighteen years of age.\nThese regulations could result in our having to modify our products and services and incur additional costs to\noperate and monitor minors\u2019 experiences on our products and services.\n\u2022 Consumer protection: Consumer protection laws, including the EU\u2019s New Deal for Consumers, which could\nresult in monetary penalties and create a range of new compliance obligations.\nIn addition, the applicability and scope of these and other laws and regulations, as interpreted by courts,\nregulators, or administrative bodies, remain uncertain and could be interpreted in ways that harm our business. For\nexample, we rely on statutory safe harbors, like those set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Section 230\nof the Communications Decency Act in the U.S. and the Digital Services Act in Europe, to protect against liability for\nvarious linking, caching, ranking, recommending, and hosting activities. Legislation or court rulings affecting these safe\nharbors may harm us and may impose significant operational challenges. There are legislative proposals and pending\nlitigation in the U.S., EU, and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for websites and\nonline platforms.

In response, we have implemented robust programs, adopted reporting frameworks and\nprinciples, and announced a number of complex and ambitious goals and initiatives that may require considerable\ninvestments. We cannot guarantee that our goals and initiatives will be fully realized on the timelines we expect or at\nall, and projects that are completed as planned may not achieve the results we anticipate.\nWe are and may continue to be subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and\ninvestigations, enforcement actions, consent orders, and other forms of regulatory scrutiny and legal liability,\nincluding competition matters, that could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating\nresults.\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and investigations, other proceedings,\nand orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and\nemployment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or\npublishers using our platforms, personal injury, and other matters.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), various U.S. states, and other plaintiffs have filed, and may continue to file\nin the future, several antitrust lawsuits about various aspects of our business, including our advertising technologies\nand practices, the operation and distribution of Google Search, and the operation and distribution of the Android\noperating system and Play Store.\nFor example, the DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit alleging that Google violated\nantitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising, and in August 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of\nColumbia ruled that Google violated such antitrust laws. The Court is holding a separate proceeding to determine\nremedies, which could include alterations to our products and services and our business models and operations,\nincluding structural remedies, and/or our distribution arrangements, among other changes. While we plan to appeal,\nthere can be no assurance that our appeal will succeed, or that we will be able to change or decrease the severity of\nany remedies that may be ordered, and any or all of these potential remedies could harm our business, reputation,\nfinancial condition, and operating results.\nAlso, in December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict in Epic Games v. Google finding that Google violated\nantitrust laws relating to Google Play's business. The presiding judge issued a remedies decision in October 2024 that\nordered a variety of alterations to our business models and operations and contractual agreements for Android and\nGoogle Play. We are appealing the verdict, but if we are unsuccessful, we could face significant expenses to\nimplement the remedies, and such costs and alterations could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and\noperating results.\nFurthermore, in December 2020, several State Attorneys General, led by the Texas Attorney General, filed an\nantitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that Google violated antitrust and\nother laws relating to its advertising technology. This case is set for trial in March 2025, and we could face significant\ncivil penalties. In January 2023, the DOJ and several Attorneys General sued in the Eastern District of Virginia alleging\nsimilar antitrust violations relating to Google\u2019s advertising technology. Trial in the DOJ matter concluded in September\n2024 with a decision expected in early 2025. If we are unsuccessful, we could face an order on remedies that could\nharm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition to these regulatory proceedings, private individual and collective actions that overlap with claims\npursued by regulators are pending in the U.S. and in several other jurisdictions. Adverse results in these or similar\nfuture lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages and remedies that could harm our business, reputation,\nfinancial condition, and operating results.\nOther regulatory agencies in the U.S. and around the world, including competition enforcers, consumer protection\nagencies, and data protection authorities, have challenged and may continue to challenge our business practices and\ncompliance with laws and regulations. We are cooperating with these investigations and defending litigation or\nappealing decisions where appropriate.\nWe are also subject to a variety of claims including product warranty, product liability, and consumer protection\nclaims related to product defects, among other litigation, and we may also be subject to claims involving health and\nsafety, hazardous materials usage, other environmental effects, AI training, development, and commercialization, or\nservice disruptions or failures. Claims have been brought, and we expect will continue to be brought, against us for\n20.",

Any of these legal proceedings could\nalso result in legal costs, diversion of management resources, and negative publicity, all of which could harm our\nbusiness, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nEstimating liabilities for our pending proceedings is a complex, fact-specific, and speculative process that requires\nsignificant judgment, and the amounts we are ultimately liable for may be less than or exceed our estimates. The\nresolution of one or more such proceedings has resulted in, and may in the future result in, additional substantial fines,\npenalties, injunctions, and other sanctions that could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating\nresults.\nFor additional information about the ongoing material legal proceedings to which we are subject, see Legal\nProceedings in Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPrivacy, data protection, data usage, and portability regulations are complex and rapidly evolving areas.\nAny failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws could harm our business, reputation, financial\ncondition, and operating results.\nAuthorities around the world have adopted and are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals\nconcerning data protection, data usage and portability, and encryption of user data. Additionally, the increasing\nadoption of AI technologies, which rely on the collection of large amounts of data and use of such data for training\npurposes, has led data protection authorities around the world to consider and adopt new and evolving interpretations\nof data protection laws, imposing specific obligations with respect to the processing of personal data, including\nrequired notices, consents, and opt-outs. Further, the increased risk of inadvertent disclosure of confidential\ninformation or personal data in connection with the utilization of AI technologies may result in stronger regulatory\nscrutiny, leading to legal and regulatory investigations and enforcement actions that may negatively affect our\nbusiness, even if unfounded. Adverse legal rulings, legislation, or regulation have resulted in, and may continue to\nresult in, fines and orders requiring that we change our practices, which have had and could continue to have an\nadverse effect on how we provide services, harming our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating\nresults. These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and compliance obligations could cause\nus to incur substantial costs or harm the quality and operations of our products and services in ways that harm our\nbusiness. Examples of these laws include:\n\u2022 The EU General Data Protection Regulation and the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulations,\nwhich apply to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or the United Kingdom,\nrespectively, or related to products and services that we offer to EU or the United Kingdom users or customers,\nrespectively, or the monitoring of their behavior in the EU or the UK, respectively.\n\u2022 Various U.S. federal, U.S. state, and foreign privacy laws related to the processing and security of personal\ndata, including (1) comprehensive privacy laws that provide data privacy rights (including, in California, a\nprivate right of action in the event of a data breach resulting from our failure to implement and maintain\nreasonable security procedures and practices) and impose significant obligations on controllers and\nprocessors of consumer data; (2) laws imposing obligations on businesses that collect or disclose biometric\ninformation (including, in Illinois, Texas, and Washington); (3) laws governing the collection and processing of\nchildren and minor\u2019s data and how companies provide age appropriate online experiences (including, in the\nU.S., the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, the pending Children and Teens' Online Privacy\nProtection Act (COPPA 2.0), which passed the U.S. Senate in 2024, and similar U.S. state laws related to\nchildren\u2019s privacy, such as the New York Child Data Protection Act, and the United Kingdom\u2019s Age-Appropriate\nDesign Code); and (4) laws regulating internet-connected devices (such as, in California, the Internet of Things\nSecurity Law).\n\u2022 The EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act, which will require in-scope companies to obtain user consent for combining data\nacross certain products and require search engines to share anonymized data with rival companies, among\nother changes; and the EU Data Act, which introduces new data portability requirements with respect to\nconnected products (i.e., \u2018internet of things\u2019 products) and related services, as well as interoperability\nobligations on data processing services.\n21.",

The validity of various data transfer mechanisms we\ncurrently rely upon remains subject to legal, regulatory, and political developments globally, which may require us to\nadapt our existing arrangements.\nWe face, and may continue to face, intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, violation of\nrights of publicity, and other claims that could be costly to defend, result in significant damage awards or\nother costs (including indemnification awards), and limit our ability to use certain technologies.\nWe, like other internet, technology, and media companies, are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations\nof infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights, including patent, copyright, trade secrets, and\ntrademarks. Parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in U.S. and international courts\nand the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) for exclusion and cease-and-desist orders. In addition, patent-\nholding companies may frequently seek to generate income from patents they have obtained by bringing claims\nagainst us. As we continue to expand our business, the number of intellectual property claims against us has increased\nand may continue to increase as we develop and acquire new products, services, and technologies, including AI\ntechnologies.\nAdverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing\nagreements (if licenses are available at all), or orders limiting our ability to sell our products and services in the U.S. or\nelsewhere, including by preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services in certain\njurisdictions. They may also cause us to change our business practices in ways that could result in a loss of revenues\nfor us and otherwise harm our business.\nMany of our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require us to defend\nagainst certain intellectual property infringement claims and in some cases indemnify them for certain intellectual\nproperty infringement claims against them, which could result in increased costs for defending such claims or\nsignificant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Such customers and partners may also\ndiscontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could\nresult in loss of revenues and harm our business. Moreover, intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our\nsuppliers, when obtainable, may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers arising from\nintellectual property infringement claims. Furthermore, in connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in\nthe future agree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, including those associated with intellectual\nproperty claims. Regardless of their merits, intellectual property claims are often time consuming and expensive to\nlitigate or settle. To the extent such claims are successful, they could harm our business, including our product and\nservice offerings, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or\nexposure to additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions.\nOur effective tax rates are affected by a variety of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with\ndifferent statutory tax rates, net gains and losses on hedges and related transactions under our foreign exchange risk\nmanagement program, changes in our stock price for shares issued as employee compensation, changes in the\nvaluation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, and the application of different provisions of tax laws or changes in tax\nlaws, regulations, or accounting principles (including changes in the interpretation of existing laws). Further, if we are\nunable or fail to collect taxes on behalf of customers, employees and partners as the withholding agent, we could\nbecome liable for taxes that are levied against third parties.\nWe are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. As a result, we have\nreceived, and may in the future receive, assessments in multiple jurisdictions, on various tax-related assertions, such\nas transfer-pricing adjustments or permanent-establishment claims. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit\ncould harm our financial condition and operating results, require adverse changes to our business practices, or subject\nus to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income\ntaxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and often involves uncertainty. Although we believe our\nestimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements\nand may affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nFurthermore, due to shifting economic and political conditions, tax policies, laws, or rates in various jurisdictions\nmay be subject to significant changes in ways that could harm our financial condition and operating results.

In September 2024, the European Court of Justice rejected our appeal and\nupheld the \u20ac2.4 billion fine. In the third quarter of 2024, we made a cash payment of $3.0 billion for the fine.\n\u2022 Android: In July 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google\u2019s Android-related\ndistribution agreements infringed European antitrust laws, imposed a \u20ac4.3 billion fine, and directed the\ntermination of the conduct at issue. We appealed the EC decision and implemented changes to certain of our\nAndroid distribution practices. In September 2022, the General Court affirmed the EC decision but reduced the\nfine from \u20ac4.3 billion to \u20ac4.1 billion. We subsequently appealed the General Court's affirmation of the EC\ndecision with the European Court of Justice, which remains pending. In 2018, we recognized a charge of\n$5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in 2022.\n\u2022 AdSense for Search: In March 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google's\nagreements with AdSense for Search partners infringed European antitrust laws, imposed a fine of \u20ac1.5 billion,\nand directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners' agreements, which we implemented prior to the\ndecision. In 2019, we recognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine and appealed the EC decision. In\nSeptember 2024, the General Court overturned the EC decision and annulled the \u20ac1.5 billion fine. The EC has\nappealed the General Court's decision with the European Court of Justice.\n\u2022 Search: In October 2020, the DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District\nCourt for the District of Columbia alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and\nSearch advertising. In August 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that Google\nviolated such U.S. antitrust laws. A separate proceeding is being held to determine remedies, the range of\nwhich vary widely. The DOJ has proposed a high level remedy framework, which includes alterations to our\nproducts and services and our business models and operations, including structural remedies, and/or our\ndistribution arrangements, among other changes, some of which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness. We have filed our own remedies proposal ahead of a hearing on remedies in April 2025. We expect\na decision likely in the second half of 2025, after which we intend to appeal.\nFurther, in June 2022, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and in October 2023, the\nJapanese Fair Trade Commission each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\nGiven the nature of these matters, we cannot estimate a possible loss.\n\u2022 Advertising Technology: In December 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state\ndeceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology, and a trial is scheduled for March 2025. Additionally,\nin January 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state Attorneys General, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to its\nadvertising technology, and a number of additional state Attorneys General subsequently joined the lawsuit.\nThe trial ended in September 2024, and we expect a decision in early 2025.\nFurther, in June 2023, the EC issued a Statement of Objections informing Google of its preliminary view that\nGoogle violated European antitrust laws relating to its advertising technology, to which we responded.\nGiven the nature of these matters, we cannot estimate a possible loss.\n\u2022 Google Play: In July 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the\nNorthern District of California alleging that Google\u2019s operation of Android and Google Play violated U.S.\nantitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In September 2023, we reached a settlement\nin principle with 50 state Attorneys General and three territories and recognized a charge. Final approval of the\nsettlement remains pending before the court. In May 2024, we funded the settlement amount to an escrow\nagent.\nIn December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict in Epic Games v. Google finding that Google violated\nU.S. antitrust laws related to Google Play's business. Epic did not seek monetary damages. The presiding\njudge issued a remedies decision in October 2024, ordering a variety of alterations to our business models and\noperations and contractual agreements for Android and Google Play. We are appealing the verdict and the trial\ncourt judge temporarily paused the implementation of the remedies while the Court of Appeals considers our\nrequest to pause implementation of the remedies pending the duration of the appeal. Given the nature of this\nmatter, we cannot estimate a possible loss.\n79.",

Given the\npreliminary stages of this matter, we cannot estimate a possible loss.\nIn addition to these proceedings, private individual and collective actions that overlap with claims pursued by\nregulatory authorities are pending in the U.S. and in several other jurisdictions.\nWe believe we have strong arguments against these open claims and will defend ourselves vigorously. We\ncontinue to cooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\nPrivacy Matters\nWe are subject to a number of privacy-related laws and regulations, and we currently are party to a number of\nprivacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. For example, there are ongoing investigations and\nlitigation in the U.S. and the EU, including those relating to our collection and use of location information, alleged\nviolations of state biometric statutes, the choices we offer users, and advertising practices, which could result in\nsignificant fines, judgments, and product changes.\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these\nlawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders\npreventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change\nour business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for\nus and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly\nbecome an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can\nresult in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a\nprohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important\nproducts into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products. Further, our\ncustomers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions\nor otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\nOther\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and investigations, other proceedings,\nand consent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance,\nlabor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by\nadvertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example,\nwe periodically have data incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. Such claims, consent\norders, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings could result in substantial fines and\npenalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our products and services,\nalterations to our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences,\nall of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, some matters concern civil judgments that\ninclude compounding penalties imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts,\nincluding those of sanctioned parties. We do not expect these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse\neffect.\nNon-Income Taxes\nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The\nsubject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the\nsale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We accrue\nnon-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when\na loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of\nloss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of\nthese matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially different from our\nexpectations.\nSee Note 14 for information regarding income tax contingencies.\n80.",

Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practices, as well\nas changes to other companies\u2019 advertising and/or data privacy practices have in the past, and may in the future, affect\nthe advertising that we are able to provide. In addition, technologies have been developed that make customized ads\nmore difficult or that block the display of ads altogether, and some providers of online services have integrated these\ntechnologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of third-party digital advertising. Failing to\nprovide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively and competitively could harm our business, reputation,\nfinancial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions. Adverse\nmacroeconomic conditions have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in\nfluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and\noperating results.\nWe face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that\nare useful to users, customers, and other partners, we may not remain competitive, which could harm our\nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. Our businesses face changing\ntechnologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete successfully,\nwe must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful products, services,\nand technologies in a timely manner. As our businesses evolve, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a\nwider range of products and services. We must continue to invest significant resources in R&D, including through\nacquisitions, in order to enhance our technology and new and existing products and services.\nWe have many competitors in different industries. Our current and potential domestic and international\ncompetitors range from large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Some competitors have longer\noperating histories and well established relationships in various sectors. They can use their experience and resources\nin ways that could affect our competitive position, including by making acquisitions, continuing to invest heavily in R&D\nand in talent, initiating intellectual property and competition claims (whether or not meritorious), and continuing to\ncompete for users, advertisers, customers, and content providers. Further, discrepancies in enforcement of existing\nlaws may enable our lesser known competitors to aggressively interpret those laws without commensurate scrutiny,\nthereby affording them competitive advantages. Our competitors may also be able to innovate and provide products\nand services faster than we can or may foresee the need for products and services before us.\nOur financial condition and operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive to the\nevolving needs and desires of our users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. As new and\nexisting technologies continue to develop, competitors and new entrants may be able to offer experiences that are, or\nthat are seen to be, substantially similar to or better than ours. These technologies could reduce usage of our products\nand services, and force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources to develop and operate equal\nor better products and services. Competitors\u2019 success in providing compelling products and services or in attracting\nand retaining users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers could harm our financial condition and\noperating results.\nOur ongoing investment in new businesses, products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and\ncould divert management attention and harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services, and technologies. The\ninvestments that we are making across our businesses, such as in AI, reflect our ongoing efforts to innovate and\nprovide products and services that are useful to users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. Our\ninvestments span a wide range of industries beyond online advertising. Such investments ultimately may not be\ncommercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital and, in pursuing new strategies, we may incur\nunanticipated liabilities. These endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including diversion of\nresources and management attention from current operations and the use of alternative investment, governance, or\ncompensation structures that may fail to adequately align incentives across the company or otherwise accomplish their\nobjectives.\nWithin Google Services, we continue to invest heavily in hardware, including our smartphones, home devices,\nand wearables, which is a highly competitive market with frequent introduction of new products and services, rapid\nadoption of technological advancements by competitors, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards,\ncontinual improvement in performance characteristics, and price and feature sensitivity on the part of consumers and\nbusinesses.

If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in\nother people using the word \u201cGoogle\u201d to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand.\nAny significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete.\nAlso, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of\nour intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our financial condition and operating\nresults.\nOur business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our\nability to expand our base of users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners.\nOur strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the\nbrands within Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch\nnew and innovative products and services that better serve the needs of our users, advertisers, customers, content\nproviders, and other partners. Our brands have been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by a number of\nfactors, including, among others, reputational issues, third-party content shared on our platforms, data privacy and\nsecurity issues and developments, and product or technical performance failures. For example, if we fail to respond\nappropriately to the sharing of misinformation or objectionable content on our services and/or products or objectionable\npractices by advertisers, or otherwise to adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence in our\nbrands.\nFurthermore, failure to maintain and enhance our brands could harm our business, reputation, financial condition,\nand operating results. Our success will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to\nprovide high-quality, trustworthy, innovative products and services that are truly useful and play a valuable role in a\nrange of settings.\nWe face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that could harm our business, financial\ncondition, and operating results.\nWe face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management, which could affect our ability\nto supply both our products and our services.\nWe rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture or assemble our hardware products and servers and\nnetworking equipment used in our technical infrastructure, and we may supply the contract manufacturers with\ncomponents to assemble the hardware products and equipment. We also rely on other companies to participate in the\ndistribution of our products and services. Our business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage these\ncompanies with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage fail to meet their\nobligations (whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons), or make adverse changes in the pricing or other\nmaterial terms of our arrangements with them.\nWe have experienced and/or may in the future experience supply shortages, price increases, and/or longer lead\ntimes that could negatively affect our operations, driven by raw material, component availability, manufacturing\ncapacity, labor shortages, industry allocations, logistics capacity, inflation, foreign currency exchange rates, tariffs,\nsanctions and export controls, trade disputes and barriers, geopolitical tensions, armed conflicts, natural disasters or\npandemics, the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant\nair quality effects and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention, and increased storm severity), power loss,\nand significant changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers. In addition, some of the components we\nuse in our technical infrastructure and our hardware products are available from only one or limited sources, and we\nmay not be able to find replacement vendors on favorable terms in the event of a supply chain disruption. A significant\nsupply interruption that affects us or our vendors could delay critical data center upgrades or expansions and delay\nconsumer product availability.\nWe may enter into long-term contracts for materials and products that commit us to significant terms and\nconditions. We may face costs for materials and products that are not consumed due to market demand, technological\nchange, changed consumer preferences, quality, product recalls, and warranty issues. For instance, because certain of\nour hardware supply contracts have volume-based pricing or minimum purchase requirements, if the volume of our\nhardware sales decreases or does not reach projected targets, we could face increased materials and manufacturing\ncosts or other financial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit to manufacture and harm our\nfinancial condition and operating results. Furthermore, certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable\ncontractual terms based on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and\nmay affect our supply.\nOur products and services have had, and in the future may have, quality issues resulting from design,\nmanufacturing, or operations. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other\n12",

Although we\nhedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S.\ndollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenues and earnings. Hedging programs are also inherently\nrisky and could expose us to additional risks that could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in the fair values of our investments and, in some instances, our financial\nstatements incorporate valuation methodologies that are subjective in nature resulting in fluctuations over\ntime.\nThe fair value of our investments may in the future be, and certain investments have been in the past, negatively\naffected by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, performance and financial results of the underlying entities, foreign\nexchange rates, changes in interest rates, including changes that may result from the implementation of new\nbenchmark rates, the effect of new or changing regulations, the stock market in general, or other factors.\nWe measure certain of our non-marketable equity and debt securities, certain other instruments including stock-\nbased compensation awards settled in the stock of certain Other Bets, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a\nbusiness combination, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The determination of fair value involves use of appropriate\nvaluation methods and certain unobservable inputs, requires management judgment and estimation, and may change\nover time. We adjust the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities to fair value for observable transactions\nof identical or similar investments of the same issuer or for impairments. All gains and losses on non-marketable equity\nsecurities, are recognized in other income (expense), which increases the volatility of our other income (expense). The\nunrealized gains and losses we record from fair value remeasurements of our non-marketable equity securities in any\nparticular period may differ significantly from the gains or losses we ultimately realize on such investments.\nAs a result of these factors, the value of our investments could decline, which could harm our financial condition\nand operating results.\nRisks Related to our Industry\nPeople access the Internet through a variety of platforms and devices that continue to evolve with the\nadvancement of technology and user preferences. If manufacturers and users do not widely adopt versions of\nour products and services developed for these interfaces, our business could be harmed.\nPeople access the Internet through a growing variety of devices such as desktop computers, mobile phones,\nsmartphones, laptops and tablets, video game consoles, voice-activated speakers, wearables, automobiles, and\ntelevision-streaming devices. Our products and services may be less popular on some interfaces. Each manufacturer\nor distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices, and our products and services may not be\navailable or may only be available with limited functionality for our users or our advertisers on these devices as a\nresult. Some manufacturers may also elect not to include our products on their devices. In addition, search queries\nmay be undertaken via voice-activated search, apps, social media or other platforms, which could harm our business.\nIt is hard to predict the challenges we may encounter in adapting our products and services and developing\ncompetitive new products and services.

Failing to attract and retain a substantial\nnumber of new device manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, developers, and users, or failing to develop products and\ntechnologies that work well on new devices and platforms, could harm our business, financial condition, and operating\nresults and ability to capture future business opportunities.\nData privacy and security concerns relating to our technology and our practices could harm our\nreputation, cause us to incur significant liability, and deter current and potential users or customers from\nusing our products and services.

Software bugs, theft, misuse, defects, vulnerabilities in our products and services, and security breaches\nexpose us to a risk of loss or improper use and disclosure of such information, which could result in litigation and other\npotential liabilities, including regulatory fines and penalties, as well as reputational harm. Additionally, our products\nincorporate highly technical and complex technologies, and thus our technologies and software have contained, and\nare likely in the future to contain, undetected errors, bugs, and/or vulnerabilities. We have in the past discovered, and\nmay in the future discover, some errors in our software code only after we have released the code. Systems and\ncontrol failures, security breaches, failure to comply with our privacy policies, and/or inadvertent disclosure of user data\ncould result in government and legal exposure, seriously harm our reputation, brand, and business, and impair our\nability to attract and retain users or customers. Such incidents have occurred in the past and may continue to occur\ndue to the scale and nature of our products and services. While there is no guarantee that such incidents will not cause\nsignificant damage, we expect to continue to expend significant resources to maintain security protections that limit the\neffect of bugs, theft, misuse, and security vulnerabilities or breaches.\nWe experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis.\nCyber attacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods\nof time. We have seen, and will continue to see, industry-wide software supply chain vulnerabilities, such as the Log4j\nvulnerability reported in December 2021, which could affect our or other parties\u2019 systems. We expect to continue to\nexperience such incidents or vulnerabilities in the future. Our efforts to address undesirable activity on our platform\nmay also increase the risk of retaliatory attack. In addition, we face the risk of cyber attacks by nation-states and state-\nsponsored actors. These attacks may target us or our customers, particularly our public sector customers (including\nfederal, state, and local governments). Geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, such as the ongoing conflict in\nUkraine, may increase these risks.\nWe may experience security issues, whether due to employee or insider error or malfeasance, system errors, or\nvulnerabilities in our or other parties\u2019 systems. While we may not determine some of these issues to be material at the\ntime they occur and may remedy them quickly, there is no guarantee that these issues will not ultimately result in\nsignificant legal, financial, and reputational harm, including government inquiries, enforcement actions, litigation, and\nnegative publicity. There is also no guarantee that a series of issues may not be determined to be material at a later\ndate in the aggregate, even if they may not be material individually at the time of their occurrence. Because the\ntechniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, disable or degrade service provided by or otherwise sabotage\nsystems change frequently and often are recognized only after being launched against a target, even taking all\nreasonable precautions, including those required by law, we have been unable in the past and may continue to be\nunable to anticipate or detect attacks or vulnerabilities or implement adequate preventative measures.\nFurther, if any partners with whom we share user or other customer information fail to implement adequate data-\nsecurity practices, fail to comply with our terms and policies, or otherwise suffer a network or other security breach, our\nusers\u2019 data may be improperly accessed, used, or disclosed. If an actual or perceived breach of our or our business\npartners\u2019 or service providers\u2019 security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures\nwould be harmed, we could lose users and customers, our trade secrets or those of our business partners may be\ncompromised, and we may be exposed to significant legal and financial risks, including legal claims (which may\ninclude class-action litigation) and regulatory actions, fines, and penalties. Any of the foregoing consequences could\nharm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWhile we have dedicated significant resources to privacy and security incident response capabilities, including\ndedicated worldwide incident response teams, our response process, particularly during times of a natural disaster or\npandemic, may not be adequate, may fail to accurately assess the severity of an incident, may not be fast enough to\nprevent or limit harm, or may fail to sufficiently remediate an incident. As a result, we may suffer significant legal,\nreputational, or financial exposure, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nFor additional information, see also our risk factor on privacy and data protection regulations under \u2018Risks Related\nto Laws, Regulations, and Policies\u2019 below.\nOur ongoing investments in safety, security, and content review will likely continue to identify abuse of\nour platforms and misuse of user data.\nIn addition to our efforts to prevent and mitigate cyber attacks, we are making significant investments in safety,\nsecurity, and review efforts to combat misuse of our services and unauthorized access to user data by third parties,\nincluding investigation and review of platform applications that could access the information of users of our services.\nAs a result of these efforts, we have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, incidents of unnecessary\naccess to or misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties.

Any of the foregoing developments may negatively affect user trust and engagement, harm our reputation\nand brands, require us to change our business practices in ways that harm our business operations, and adversely\naffect our business and financial results. Any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and\nregulatory inquiries, which could result in monetary penalties and damages, divert management\u2019s time and attention,\nand lead to enhanced regulatory oversight.\nProblematic content on our platforms, including low-quality user-generated content, web spam, content\nfarms, and other violations of our guidelines could affect the quality of our services, which could harm our\nreputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services.\nWe, like others in the industry, face violations of our content guidelines across our platforms, including\nsophisticated attempts by bad actors to manipulate our hosting and advertising systems to fraudulently generate\nrevenues, or to otherwise generate traffic that does not represent genuine user interest or intent. While we invest\nsignificantly in efforts to promote high-quality and relevant results and to detect and prevent low-quality content and\ninvalid traffic, we have been unable and may continue to be unable to detect and prevent all such abuses or promote\nuniformly high-quality content.\nMany websites violate or attempt to violate our guidelines, including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in\nsearch results than our search engine's assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them. Such efforts have\naffected, and may continue to affect, the quality of content on our platforms and lead them to display false, misleading,\nor undesirable content. Although English-language web spam in our search results has been reduced, and web spam\nin most other languages is limited, we expect web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improve their\nrankings. We continuously combat web spam in our search results, including through indexing technology that makes it\nharder for spam-like, less useful web content to rank highly. We also continue to invest in and deploy proprietary\ntechnology to detect and prevent web spam on our platforms. We also face other challenges from low-quality and\nirrelevant content websites, including content farms, which are websites that generate large quantities of low-quality\ncontent to help them improve their search rankings. We are continually launching algorithmic changes designed to\ndetect and prevent abuse from low-quality websites. We also face other challenges on our platforms, including\nviolations of our content guidelines involving incidents such as attempted election interference, activities that threaten\nthe safety and/or well-being of our users on- or off-line, and the spreading of misinformation or disinformation.\nIf we fail to either detect and prevent an increase in problematic content or effectively promote high-quality\ncontent, it could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information or reduce use of our platforms, harming our\nfinancial condition and operating results. It may also subject us to litigation and regulatory actions, which could result in\nmonetary penalties and damages and divert management\u2019s time and attention.\nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users. Internet\naccess providers may be able to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and\nservices, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers.\nOur products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet, and certain of our products\nrequire significant bandwidth to work effectively. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant\nmarket power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable\ncompanies, mobile communications companies, and government-owned service providers. Some of these providers\nhave taken, or have stated that they may take, measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user\naccess to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our\nofferings, by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings, or by providing our competitors\npreferential access. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by internet\naccess providers; however, substantial uncertainty exists in the U.S. and elsewhere regarding such protections.

In\naddition, in some jurisdictions, our products and services have been subject to government-initiated restrictions or\nblockages. These could harm existing key relationships, including with our users, customers, advertisers, and/or\ncontent providers, and impair our ability to attract new ones; harm our reputation; and increase costs, thereby\nnegatively affecting our business.\nRisks Related to Laws, Regulations, and Policies\nWe are subject to a variety of new, existing, and changing laws and regulations worldwide that could\nharm our business, and will likely be subject to an even broader scope of laws and regulations as we continue\nto expand our business.\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subjects, and our\nintroduction of new businesses, products, services, and technologies will likely continue to subject us to additional laws\nand regulations. In recent years, governments around the world have proposed and adopted a large number of new\nlaws and regulations relevant to the digital economy, particularly in the areas of data privacy and security, competition,\nand online content. The costs of compliance with these measures are high and are likely to increase in the future.\nNew or changing laws and regulations, or new interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a\nmanner inconsistent with our practices, have resulted in, and may continue to result in, less useful products and\nservices, altered business practices, limited ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products and\nservices, substantial costs, and civil or criminal liability. Examples include laws and regulations regarding:\n\u2022 Competition and technology platforms\u2019 business practices: Laws and regulations focused on large\ntechnology platforms, including the Digital Markets Act in the European Union (EU); regulations in South Korea\nand elsewhere that affect Google Play\u2019s billing policies, fees, and business model; as well as regulations under\nconsideration in a range of jurisdictions.\n\u2022 Data privacy, collection, and processing: Laws and regulations further restricting the collection, processing,\nand/or sharing of user or advertising-related data, including privacy and data protection laws, laws affecting the\nprocessing of children's data (as discussed further below), data breach notification laws, and laws limiting data\ntransfers (including data localization laws).\n\u2022 Copyright and other intellectual property: Copyright and related laws, including the EU Directive on\nCopyright in the Digital Single Market and European Economic Area transpositions, which may introduce new\nlicensing regimes, increase liability with respect to content uploaded by users or linked to from our platforms,\nor create property rights in news publications that could require payments to news agencies and publishers.\n\u2022 Content moderation: Various laws covering content moderation and removal, and related disclosure\nobligations, such as the EU's Digital Services Act, Florida\u2019s Senate Bill 7072 and Texas\u2019 House Bill 20, and\nlaws and proposed legislation in Singapore, Australia, and the United Kingdom that impose penalties for failure\nto remove certain types of content or require disclosure of information about the operation of our services and\nalgorithms, which may make it harder for services like Google Search and YouTube to detect and deal with\nlow-quality, deceptive, or harmful content.\n\u2022 Consumer protection: Consumer protection laws, including the EU\u2019s New Deal for Consumers, which could\nresult in monetary penalties and create a range of new compliance obligations.\nIn addition, the applicability and scope of these and other laws and regulations, as interpreted by the courts,\nremain uncertain and could be interpreted in ways that harm our business. For example, we rely on statutory safe\nharbors, like those set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Section 230 of the Communications Decency\nAct in the U.S. and the E-Commerce Directive in Europe, to protect against liability for various linking, caching, ranking,\nrecommending, and hosting activities. Legislation or court rulings affecting these safe harbors may adversely affect us\nand may impose significant operational challenges. There are legislative proposals and pending litigation in the U.S.\n(such as Gonzalez v. Google), EU, and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for\nwebsites and online platforms.\nWe are and may continue to be subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations,\nenforcement actions, consent orders, and other forms of regulatory scrutiny and legal liability that could harm\nour business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent\norders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and\nemployment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or\npublishers using our platforms, personal injury, and other matters.

Other\nregulatory agencies in the U.S. and around the world, including competition enforcers, consumer protection agencies,\nand data protection authorities, have challenged and may continue to challenge our business practices and\ncompliance with laws and regulations. We are cooperating with these investigations and defending litigation where\nappropriate. Various laws, regulations, investigations, enforcement lawsuits, and regulatory actions have in the past,\nand may in the future result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing\nobligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral\nrelated civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial\ncondition, and operating results.\nAny of these legal proceedings could result in legal costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity\nand other harms to our business. Estimating liabilities for our pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that\nrequires significant judgment, and the amounts we are ultimately liable for may exceed our estimates. The resolution of\none or more such proceedings has resulted in, and may in the future result in, additional substantial fines, penalties,\ninjunctions, and other sanctions that could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nPrivacy, data protection, and data usage regulations are complex and rapidly evolving areas. Any failure\nor alleged failure to comply with these laws could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and\noperating results.\nAuthorities around the world have adopted and are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals\nconcerning data protection, data usage, and encryption of user data. Adverse legal rulings, legislation, or regulation\nhave resulted in, and may continue to result in, fines and orders requiring that we change our practices, which have\nhad and could continue to have an adverse effect on how we provide services, harming our business, reputation,\nfinancial condition, and operating results. These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and\ncompliance obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs or harm the quality and operations of our products\nand services in ways that harm our business. Examples of these laws include:\n\u2022 The General Data Protection Regulation and the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulations, which\napply to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or the United Kingdom, respectively, or\nrelated to products and services that we offer to EU or the United Kingdom users or customers, respectively, or\nthe monitoring of their behavior in the EU or the UK, respectively.\n\u2022 Various state and foreign privacy laws and regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018,\nthe California Privacy Rights Act, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, the Colorado Privacy Act, the\nConnecticut Data Privacy Act, and the Utah Consumer Privacy Act, all of which give new data privacy rights to\ntheir respective residents (including, in California, a private right of action in the event of a data breach\nresulting from our failure to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices) and\nimpose significant obligations on controllers and processors of consumer data.\n\u2022 State laws governing the processing of biometric information, such as the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy\nAct and the Texas Capture or Use of Biometric Identifier Act, which impose obligations on businesses that\ncollect or disclose consumer biometric information.\n\u2022 Various federal, state, and foreign laws governing how companies provide age appropriate experiences to\nchildren and minors, including the collection and processing of children and minor\u2019s data. These include the\nChildren\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, the United Kingdom Age-Appropriate Design Code, and the\nCalifornia Age Appropriate Design Code, all of which address the use and disclosure of the personal data of\nchildren and minors and impose obligations on online services or products directed to or likely to be accessed\nby children.\n\u2022 The California Internet of Things Security Law, which regulates the security of data used in connection with\ninternet-connected devices.\n18",

Previously available transfer mechanisms, such as the EU-U.S.\nand the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks, were invalidated in 2020, and other bases for data transfer and\nstorage, such as Standard Contractual Clauses, remain subject to ongoing review in ways that may require us to adapt\nour existing contractual arrangements. The validity of various data transfer mechanisms remains subject to legal,\nregulatory, and political developments in both Europe and the U.S., including the potential adoption of the U.S.-EU\nData Privacy Framework. Until the U.S.-EU Data Privacy Framework is adopted by the EU, the legal uncertainty and\nongoing enforcement action from supervisory authorities related to cross-border transfers of personal data, could harm\nour ability to process and transfer personal data outside of the European Economic Area and could in turn harm our\nability to provide, and our customers\u2019 ability to use, some of our products and services.\nWe face, and may continue to face, intellectual property and other claims that could be costly to defend,\nresult in significant damage awards or other costs (including indemnification awards), and limit our ability to\nuse certain technologies.\nWe, like other internet, technology, and media companies, are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations\nof infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights, including patent, copyright, trade secrets, and\ntrademarks. Parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in U.S. and international courts\nand the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) for exclusion and cease-and-desist orders. In addition, patent-\nholding companies may frequently seek to generate income from patents they have obtained by bringing claims\nagainst us. As we continue to expand our business, the number of intellectual property claims against us has increased\nand may continue to increase as we develop and acquire new products, services, and technologies.\nAdverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing\nagreements (if licenses are available at all), or orders limiting our ability to sell our products and services in the U.S. or\nelsewhere, including by preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services in certain\njurisdictions. They may also cause us to change our business practices in ways that could result in a loss of revenues\nfor us and otherwise harm our business.\nMany of our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require us to defend\nagainst certain intellectual property infringement claims and in some cases indemnify them for certain intellectual\nproperty infringement claims against them, which could result in increased costs for defending such claims or\nsignificant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Such customers and partners may also\ndiscontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could\nresult in loss of revenues and harm our business. Moreover, intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our\nsuppliers, when obtainable, may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers arising from\nintellectual property infringement claims. Furthermore, in connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in\nthe future agree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, including those associated with intellectual\nproperty claims. Regardless of their merits, intellectual property claims are often time consuming and expensive to\nlitigate or settle. To the extent such claims are successful, they could harm our business, including our product and\nservice offerings, financial condition, and operating results.\nExpectations relating to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations could expose us to\npotential liabilities, increased costs, and reputational harm.\nWe are subject to laws, regulations, and other measures that govern a wide range of topics, including those\nrelated to matters beyond our core products and services. For instance, new laws, regulations, policies, and\ninternational accords relating to ESG matters, including sustainability, climate change, human capital, and diversity, are\nbeing developed and formalized in Europe, the U.S., and elsewhere, which may entail specific, target-driven\nframeworks and/or disclosure requirements. We have implemented robust ESG programs, adopted reporting\nframeworks and principles, and announced a number of goals and initiatives. The implementation of these goals and\ninitiatives may require considerable investments, and our goals, with all of their contingencies, dependencies, and in\ncertain cases, reliance on third-party verification and/or performance, are complex and ambitious, may change, and we\ncannot guarantee that we will achieve them. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to adhere to our public statements,\ncomply fully with developing interpretations of ESG laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder\nexpectations and standards could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or\nexposure to additional tax liabilities.\n19",

As a result,\ncomparing our operating results (including our expenses as a percentage of our revenues) on a period-to-period basis\nmay not be meaningful, and our past results should not be relied on as an indication of our future performance.\nConsequently, our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations.\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures could result in operating difficulties, dilution,\nand other consequences that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures are important elements of our overall corporate strategy\nand use of capital, and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and operating results. We expect\nto continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of such potential strategic transactions, which\ncould create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Some of the areas where we face risks include:\n\u2022 diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and\nother strategic transactions;\n\u2022 failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities, or conditions\nplaced upon approval that could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or\notherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of a transaction;\n\u2022 failure to successfully integrate the acquired operations, technologies, services, and personnel (including\ncultural integration and retention of employees) and further develop the acquired business or technology;\n\u2022 implementation or remediation of controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company;\n21",

Our ability to compete\neffectively and our future success depends on our continuing to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly\nskilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense, and\ncertain of our competitors have directly targeted, and may continue to target, our employees. In addition, our\ncompensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be successful in attracting new\nemployees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Restrictive immigration policy and regulatory changes\nmay also affect our ability to hire, mobilize, or retain some of our global talent.\nIn addition, we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. As our organization\ngrows and evolves, we may need to implement more complex organizational management structures or adapt our\ncorporate culture and work environments to ever-changing circumstances, such as during times of a natural disaster or\npandemic, and these changes could affect our ability to compete effectively or have an adverse effect on our corporate\nculture.

The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit on October 20, 2020 alleging that\nGoogle violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising. Further, in June 2022, the\nAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the United Kingdom's Competition and\nMarkets Authority (CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\n\u2022 On December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state\ndeceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology. Additionally, on January 24, 2023, the DOJ, along\nwith a number of state Attorneys General, filed an antitrust complaint alleging that Google\u2019s digital advertising\ntechnology products violate U.S. antitrust laws. The EC, the CMA, and the ACCC each opened a formal\ninvestigation into Google's advertising technology business practices on June 22, 2021, May 25, 2022, and\nJune 29, 2022, respectively.\n\u2022 On July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for\nthe Northern District of California, alleging that Google\u2019s operation of Android and Google Play violated U.S.\nantitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In May 2022, the EC and the CMA each\nopened investigations into Google Play\u2019s business practices. Korean regulators are investigating Google Play's\nbilling practices, most recently opening a formal review in May 2022 of Google's compliance with the new app\nstore billing regulations.\nWe believe these complaints are without merit and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue to cooperate\nwith federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these\nlawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders\npreventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change\nour business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for\nus and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly\nbecome an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can\nresult in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a\nprohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important\nproducts into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against\ncertain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims,\nand may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our\ncustomers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions\nor otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\nOther\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent\norders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and\nemployment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or\npublishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, we currently\nhave a number of privacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. We also periodically have data\nincidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. Such claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government\ninvestigations, other proceedings, and consent orders could result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief,\nongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models\nand operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which could harm our\nbusiness, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia.

In May 2022, the EC and the CMA\neach opened investigations into Google Play\u2019s business practices. Korean regulators are investigating\nGoogle Play's billing practices, most recently opening a formal review in May 2022 of Google's compliance\nwith the new app store billing regulations.\nWe believe these complaints are without merit and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue to cooperate\nwith federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in\nthese lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or\norders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have\nto change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss\nof revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has\nincreasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC\naction can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important\nmarket, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing\nmany important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against\ncertain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such\nclaims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In\naddition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a\nresult of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\nOther\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent\norders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and\nemployment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or\npublishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, we currently\nhave a number of privacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. We also periodically have\ndata incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. Such claims, lawsuits, regulatory and\ngovernment investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders could result in substantial fines and penalties,\ninjunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to\nour business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of\nwhich could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, civil judgments that include compounding\npenalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including\nthose of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.\nNon-Income Taxes\nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters.\nThe subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied\nto the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We\naccrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax\nauthorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and\nthe loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFor a description of our material pending legal proceedings, see Note 8 \u201cCommitments and Contingencies -\nLegal Matters\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report\non Form 10-Q, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described in\nPart I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of\nour stock. Below are material changes to our risk factors since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\nRisks Specific to our Company\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising. Reduced spending by advertisers,\na loss of partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to\ncustomize ads could harm our business.\nWe generated more than 75% of total revenues from online advertising in 2023. Many of our advertisers,\ncompanies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their\ncontracts with us at any time. These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more\nvalue (such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more\neffective monetization) than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy\npractices, such as our initiatives to phase out third-party cookies (which remain subject to review, affecting the\ntiming), as well as changes to other companies\u2019 advertising and/or data privacy practices have in the past, and may\nin the future, affect the advertising that we are able to provide. In addition, technologies have been developed that\nmake customized ads more difficult, or that block the display of ads altogether, and some providers of online\nservices have integrated these technologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of third-\nparty digital advertising. Failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively and competitively\ncould harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions. Adverse\nmacroeconomic conditions have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in\nfluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and\noperating results.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Stock\nWe cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program or dividend program will be continuously\nactive or fully consummated or will enhance long-term stockholder value, and share repurchases or\ndividends could increase the volatility of our stock prices and could diminish our cash reserves.\nWe engage in share repurchases of our Class A and Class C stock from time to time in accordance with\nauthorizations from the Board of Directors of Alphabet. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date\nand does not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of\nshares. In April 2024, we announced the approval of a cash dividend to our Class A, Class B and Class C\nstockholders. Any and all future cash dividends are subject to declaration by the Board of Directors at their sole\ndiscretion, and in accordance with the requirements of any applicable laws, rules and regulations, including the\nDelaware General Corporation Law. Our cash dividend program does not require, and our Board of Directors may\nnot declare, a cash dividend each quarter, and does not obligate our Board of Directors to declare a dividend in any\nspecific dollar amount per share. Further, our share repurchases or dividends could affect our share trading prices,\nincrease their volatility, reduce our cash reserves and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may\nresult in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock.\nThe trading price for our Class A stock and non-voting Class C stock may continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our stock has at times experienced significant volatility and may continue to be volatile. In\naddition to the factors discussed in this report, the trading prices of our Class A stock and Class C stock have\nfluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate widely, in response to various factors, including, among others, the size or\ncontinuity of either our share repurchase or dividend programs, the activities of our peers and changes in broader\n43",

The EC has appealed the General Court's decision with the European Court of Justice.\n\u2022 Search: In October 2020, the DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search\nand Search advertising. In August 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that Google\nviolated such U.S. antitrust laws. A separate proceeding is being held to determine remedies, the range of\nwhich vary widely. The DOJ has proposed a high level remedy framework, which includes alterations to our\nproducts and services and our business models and operations, including structural remedies, and/or our\ndistribution arrangements, among other changes, some of which could have a material adverse effect on\nour business. We have filed our own remedies proposal ahead of a hearing on remedies in April 2025. We\nexpect a decision likely in the second half of 2025, after which we intend to appeal.\nFurther, in June 2022, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and in October 2023, the\nJapanese Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\nIn April 2025, the JFTC issued a cease-and-desist order requiring us to make changes to our Android\nagreements to ensure they are consistent with Japanese antitrust law. The JFTC did not impose monetary\npenalties. We are constructively engaging with JFTC regarding compliance with the order.\nGiven the nature of these matters, we cannot estimate a possible loss.\n\u2022 Advertising Technology: In December 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as\nstate deceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology, and a trial is scheduled for August 2025.\nAdditionally, in January 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state Attorneys General, filed a lawsuit in the\nU.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating\nto its advertising technology, and a number of additional state Attorneys General subsequently joined the\nlawsuit. In April 2025, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia issued a mixed decision in\nthe DOJ case against Google, ruling that the DOJ failed to show that Google\u2019s advertiser tools or\nacquisitions of DoubleClick and AdMeld were anticompetitive, but that Google\u2019s publisher tools violated\nantitrust laws by excluding rivals. We plan to appeal the adverse portion of this decision.\nFurther, in June 2023, the EC issued a Statement of Objections informing Google of its preliminary view that\nGoogle violated European antitrust laws relating to its advertising technology, to which we responded. In\nSeptember 2024, the UK also issued a Statement of Objections on similar grounds, to which we responded.\nGiven the nature of these matters, we cannot estimate a possible loss.\n\u2022 Google Play: In July 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for\nthe Northern District of California alleging that Google\u2019s operation of Android and Google Play violated U.S.\nantitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In September 2023, we reached a\nsettlement in principle with 50 state Attorneys General and three territories and recognized a charge. Final\napproval of the settlement remains pending before the court. In May 2024, we funded the settlement\namount to an escrow agent.\nIn December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict in Epic Games v. Google finding that Google\nviolated U.S. antitrust laws related to Google Play's business. Epic did not seek monetary damages. The\npresiding judge issued a remedies decision in October 2024, ordering a variety of alterations to our\nbusiness models and operations and contractual agreements for Android and Google Play. We are\nappealing the verdict and the trial court judge temporarily paused the implementation of the remedies while\nthe Court of Appeals considers our request to pause implementation of the remedies pending the duration\nof the appeal. Given the nature of this matter, we cannot estimate a possible loss.\n\u2022 European Digital Markets Act: In March 2024, the EC opened two investigations regarding Google's\ncompliance with certain provisions of EU's Digital Markets Act relating to Google Play and Search. In March\n2025, the EC issued preliminary findings of non-compliance in both investigations, to which we plan to\nrespond in the coming weeks. Given the preliminary stages of this matter, we cannot estimate a possible\nloss.\nIn addition to these antitrust proceedings, private individual and collective actions that overlap with claims\npursued by regulatory authorities are pending in the U.S. and in several other jurisdictions, including across Europe.\nGiven the nature of these matters, we cannot estimate a possible loss.\n26",

For example, there are ongoing investigations\nand litigation in the U.S. and the EU, including those relating to our collection and use of location information,\nalleged violations of state biometric statutes, the choices we offer users, and advertising practices, which could\nresult in significant fines, judgments, and product changes.\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in\nthese lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or\norders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have\nto change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss\nof revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has\nincreasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC\naction can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important\nmarket, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing\nmany important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\nFurther, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a\nresult of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\nOther\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and investigations, other proceedings,\nand consent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related\ncompliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services\noffered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters.\nFor example, we periodically have data incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. Such\nclaims, consent orders, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings could result in\nsubstantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our\nproducts and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or\nother adverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating\nresults.\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, some matters concern civil judgments that\ninclude compounding penalties imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts,\nincluding those of sanctioned parties. We do not expect these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse\neffect.\nNon-Income Taxes\nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters.\nThe subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied\nto the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We\naccrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax\nauthorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and\nthe loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity\nand uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially\ndifferent from our expectations.\nSee Note 14 for information regarding income tax contingencies.\n27",

We subsequently appealed the General Court's affirmation of the EC with the European Court of\nJustice, which remains pending.\nIn September 2024, the EU's General Court overturned the 2019 decision and annulled the \u20ac1.5 billion fine.\nThe EC has appealed the General Court's decision to the European Court of Justice.\nWe included the outstanding EC fines, including any under appeal, in accrued expenses and other current\nliabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For additional information, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nTaxes\nAs of March 31, 2025, we had income taxes payable of $2.7 billion related to a one-time transition tax payable\nincurred as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which is due in 2025. We also had long-term taxes payable\nof $9.8 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of March 31, 2025.\nPurchase Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations\nAs of March 31, 2025, we had material purchase commitments and other contractual obligations of $62.1\nbillion, of which $41.5 billion was short-term. These amounts primarily consist of purchase orders for certain\ntechnical infrastructure as well as the non-cancelable portion or the minimum cancellation fee in certain agreements\nrelated to commitments to purchase licenses, including content licenses, inventory, and network capacity. For those\nagreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities\nand/or pricing as of March 31, 2025. In certain instances, the amount of our contractual obligations may change\nbased on the expected timing of order fulfillment from our suppliers. For more information related to our content\nlicenses, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report\non Form 10-Q.\nIn addition, we regularly enter into multi-year, non-cancellable agreements to purchase renewable energy and\nenergy attributes, such as renewable energy certificates. These agreements do not include a minimum dollar\ncommitment. The amounts to be paid under these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated\nand are not readily determinable.\nWe may experience increases in the costs associated with our purchase commitments and other contractual\nobligations as a result of ongoing developments surrounding international trade. For details on risks related to our\nmanufacturing and supply chain and other risks, refer to Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024.\nPending Acquisition\nIn March 2025, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Wiz, a leading cloud security platform, for\n$32.0 billion, subject to closing adjustments, in an all-cash transaction. The acquisition of Wiz is expected to close in\n2026, subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals.

The DOJ's investigation of similar issues remains\nongoing. The EC, the CMA, and the ACCC each opened a formal investigation into Google's advertising\ntechnology business practices on June 22, 2021, May 25, 2022, and June 29, 2022, respectively.\n\u2022 On July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court\nfor the Northern District of California, alleging that Google\u2019s operation of Android and Google Play violated\nU.S. antitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In May 2022, the EC and the CMA\neach opened a formal investigation into Google Play\u2019s business practices. Korean regulators are\ninvestigating Google Play's billing practices, most recently opening a formal review in May 2022 of Google's\ncompliance with the new app store billing regulations.\nWe believe these complaints are without merit and will defend ourselves vigorously.

        "text": "Financial filing text section: Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\nthe EC issued a Statement of Objections (SO) informing Google of its preliminary view that Google violated\nEuropean antitrust laws relating to its advertising technology. We will respond to the SO by December 31,\n2023.\n\u2022 On July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court\nfor the Northern District of California, alleging that Google\u2019s operation of Android and Google Play violated\nU.S. antitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In May 2022, the EC and the CMA\neach opened investigations into Google Play\u2019s business practices. Korean regulators are investigating\nGoogle Play's billing practices, most recently opening a formal review in May 2022 of Google's compliance\nwith the new app store billing regulations.\nWe believe these complaints are without merit and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue to cooperate\nwith federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in\nthese lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or\norders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have\nto change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss\nof revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has\nincreasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC\naction can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important\nmarket, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing\nmany important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against\ncertain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such\nclaims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In\naddition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a\nresult of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\nOther\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent\norders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and\nemployment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or\npublishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, we currently\nhave a number of privacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. We also periodically have\ndata incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. Such claims, lawsuits, regulatory and\ngovernment investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders could result in substantial fines and penalties,\ninjunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to\nour business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of\nwhich could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, civil judgments that include compounding\npenalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including\nthose of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.\nNon-Income Taxes\nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters.\nThe subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied\nto the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We\naccrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax\nauthorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and\nthe loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity\nand uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially\ndifferent from our expectations.\nFor information regarding income tax contingencies, see Note 13.\n28",

On June 4, 2019, we appealed\nthe EC decision. We recognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019.\nIn addition, on July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Northern District of California, alleging that Google\u2019s operation of Android and Google Play violated\nU.S. antitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In September 2023, we reached a settlement\nin principle with 50 state Attorneys General and three territories. The U.S. District Court subsequently vacated the\ntrial date with the states, and we expect any final approval of the settlement would come in 2024. In May 2024, we\nfunded the settlement amount to an escrow agent.\nIn December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict in a similar lawsuit in Epic Games v. Google.

Further,\nin June 2022, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the United Kingdom's\nCompetition and Markets Authority (CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\n\u2022 On December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state\ndeceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology, and a trial is scheduled for March 2025.\nAdditionally, on January 24, 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state Attorneys General, filed an\nantitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging that Google\u2019s digital\nadvertising technology products violate U.S. antitrust laws, and on April 17, 2023, a number of additional\nstate Attorneys General joined the complaint. A trial is scheduled for September 2024. The EC, the CMA,\nand the ACCC each opened a formal investigation into Google's advertising technology business practices\non June 22, 2021, May 25, 2022, and June 29, 2022, respectively. On June 14, 2023, the EC issued a\nStatement of Objections (SO) informing Google of its preliminary view that Google violated European\nantitrust laws relating to its advertising technology. We responded to the SO on December 1, 2023.\n\u2022 In May 2022, the EC and the CMA each opened investigations into Google Play\u2019s business practices.\nKorean regulators are investigating Google Play's billing practices, including a formal review in May 2022 of\nGoogle's compliance with the new app store billing regulations.\nWe believe we have strong arguments against these claims and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue\nto cooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\nPrivacy Matters\nWe are subject to a number of privacy-related laws and regulations, and we currently are party to a number of\nprivacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. For example, there are ongoing investigations\nand litigation in the U.S. and the European Union, including those relating to our collection and use of location\ninformation, the choices we offer users, and advertising practices, which could result in significant fines, judgments,\nand product changes.\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights.

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, we repurchased $15.6 billion and $31.7\nbillion, respectively, of Alphabet's Class A and Class C shares.\nIn April 2023, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $70.0 billion of its\nClass A and Class C shares. In April 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to\nrepurchase up to an additional $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFor a description of our material pending legal proceedings, see Note 8 \u201cCommitments and Contingencies -\nLegal Matters\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report\non Form 10-Q, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described in\nPart I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as\nupdated in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, which could adversely affect\nour business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our stock. Below are\nmaterial changes to our risk factors since our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising. Reduced spending by advertisers,\na loss of partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to\ncustomize ads could harm our business.\nWe generated more than 75% of total revenues from online advertising in 2023. Many of our advertisers,\ncompanies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their\ncontracts with us at any time. These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more\nvalue (such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more\neffective monetization) than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy\npractices, such as our initiatives related to third-party cookies, including our recent announcement to move from\nphasing out all third-party cookies to a proposed user choice model (which remains subject to continuing\ndiscussions with regulators), as well as changes to other companies\u2019 advertising and/or data privacy practices have\nin the past, and may in the future, affect the advertising that we are able to provide. In addition, technologies have\nbeen developed that make customized ads more difficult, or that block the display of ads altogether, and some\nproviders of online services have integrated technologies that could potentially impair the availability and\nfunctionality of third-party digital advertising. Failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively\nand competitively could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions. Adverse\nmacroeconomic conditions have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in\nfluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and\noperating results.\nITEM 2.

We have\nagreed to defend and/or indemnify certain parties against losses arising from a breach of representations or\ncovenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these\nagreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In\naddition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain\nsimilar indemnification obligations to our agents.\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification\nagreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the\npayments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the\nfuture, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations or cash flows in a particular period.\nAs of June 30, 2025, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably\npossible.\nLegal Matters\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be\nreasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be\nestimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could\naffect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible\nlosses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.\nCertain outstanding matters seek speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts, substantial\nchanges to our business practices and products, or structural remedies. Significant judgment is required to\ndetermine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and\nwe may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of outstanding legal\nmatters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either individually or in\naggregate, have a material adverse effect.\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\nAntitrust Matters\nWe are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations as well as litigation on various competition\nmatters by regulatory authorities and private parties in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally, including\nthe following:\n\u2022 Shopping: In June 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google relating to its\ndisplay and ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European antitrust laws and imposed a\n\u20ac2.4 billion fine. In 2024, we made a cash payment of $3.0 billion for the fine.\n28",

We appealed the EC decision and implemented changes to certain of\nour Android distribution practices. In September 2022, the General Court affirmed the EC decision but\nreduced the fine from \u20ac4.3 billion to \u20ac4.1 billion. We subsequently appealed the General Court's affirmation\nof the EC decision with the European Court of Justice, which remains pending. In 2018, we recognized a\ncharge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in 2022.\n\u2022 AdSense for Search: In March 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google's\nagreements with AdSense for Search partners infringed European antitrust laws, imposed a fine of \u20ac1.5\nbillion, and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners' agreements, which we implemented\nprior to the decision. In 2019, we recognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine and appealed the EC\ndecision. In September 2024, the General Court overturned the EC decision and annulled the \u20ac1.5 billion\nfine. The EC has appealed the General Court's decision with the European Court of Justice.\n\u2022 Search: In October 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and a number of state Attorneys General\nfiled a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that Google violated U.S.\nantitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising. In August 2024, the U.S. District Court for the\nDistrict of Columbia ruled that Google violated such U.S. antitrust laws. A separate proceeding to determine\nremedies, the range of which vary widely, concluded in May 2025. The DOJ's remedy proposal included\nalterations to our products and services and our business models and operations, including structural\nremedies, and our distribution arrangements, among other changes, some of which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business. We expect a decision on remedies in August 2025, after which we intend to\nappeal the August 2024 ruling and, potentially, aspects of the remedies decision following our review of that\ndecision.\nFurther, in June 2022, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and in October 2023, the\nJapanese Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\nIn April 2025, the JFTC issued a cease-and-desist order requiring us to make changes to our Android\nagreements to ensure they are consistent with Japanese antitrust law. The JFTC did not impose monetary\npenalties. We are constructively engaging with JFTC regarding compliance with the order.\nGiven the nature of these matters, we cannot estimate a possible loss.\n\u2022 Advertising Technology: In December 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as\nstate deceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology. A trial will take place after a decision on\nremedies is issued in the following DOJ case against Google relating to its advertising technology. In\nJanuary 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state Attorneys General, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to its\nadvertising technology, and a number of additional state Attorneys General subsequently joined the lawsuit.\nIn April 2025, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia issued a mixed decision in the DOJ\ncase against Google, ruling that the DOJ failed to show that Google\u2019s advertiser tools or acquisitions of\nDoubleClick and AdMeld were anticompetitive, but that Google\u2019s publisher tools violated antitrust laws by\nexcluding rivals. A separate proceeding to determine remedies, the range of which vary widely, is scheduled\nto take place in September 2025. The DOJ's remedy proposal includes structural remedies, which could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business. We also filed a remedy proposal ahead of the September\nproceedings. After a decision on remedies, we plan to appeal the adverse portion of the April 2025 decision\nand, potentially, aspects of the remedies decision following our review of that decision.\nFurther, in June 2023, the EC issued a Statement of Objections informing Google of its preliminary view that\nGoogle violated European antitrust laws relating to its advertising technology, to which we responded. In\nSeptember 2024, the UK also issued a Statement of Objections on similar grounds, to which we responded.\nGiven the nature of these matters, we cannot estimate a possible loss.\n\u2022 Google Play: In July 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for\nthe Northern District of California alleging that Google\u2019s operation of Android and Google Play violated U.S.\nantitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In September 2023, we reached a\nsettlement in principle with 50 state Attorneys General and three territories and recognized a charge. Final\napproval of the settlement remains pending before the court. In May 2024, we funded the settlement\namount to an escrow agent.\n29",

The\npresiding judge issued a remedies decision in October 2024, ordering a variety of alterations to our\nbusiness models and operations and contractual agreements for Android and Google Play. We are\nappealing the verdict and the trial court judge temporarily paused the implementation of the remedies while\nthe Court of Appeals considers our request to pause implementation of the remedies pending the duration\nof the appeal. Given the nature of this matter, we cannot estimate a possible loss.\n\u2022 European Digital Markets Act: In March 2024, the EC opened two investigations regarding Google's\ncompliance with certain provisions of the European Union's (EU) Digital Markets Act relating to Google Play\nand Search. In March 2025, the EC issued preliminary findings of non-compliance in both investigations, to\nwhich we responded. Given the nature of this matter, we cannot estimate a possible loss.\nIn addition to these antitrust proceedings, private individual and collective actions that overlap with claims\npursued by regulatory authorities are pending in the U.S. and in several other jurisdictions, including across Europe.\nGiven the nature of these matters, we cannot estimate a possible loss.\nWe believe we have strong arguments against these open claims and will defend ourselves vigorously. We\ncontinue to cooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\nPrivacy Matters\nWe are subject to a number of privacy-related laws and regulations, and we currently are party to a number of\nprivacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. For example, there are ongoing investigations\nand litigation in the U.S. and the EU, including those relating to our collection and use of location information,\nalleged violations of state biometric statutes, the choices we offer users, and advertising practices, which could\nresult in significant fines, judgments, and product changes. In April 2025, we reached a $1.4 billion agreement in\nprinciple to settle certain privacy matters.\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in\nthese lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or\norders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have\nto change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss\nof revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has\nincreasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC\naction can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important\nmarket, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing\nmany important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\nFurther, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a\nresult of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\nOther\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and investigations, other proceedings,\nand consent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related\ncompliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services\noffered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, AI training, and other\nmatters. For example, we periodically have data incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law.\nSuch claims, consent orders, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings could\nresult in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to\nour products and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or\nother adverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating\nresults.\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, some matters concern civil judgments that\ninclude compounding penalties imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts,\nincluding those of sanctioned parties. We do not expect these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse\neffect.\nNon-Income Taxes\n30",

Contingencies\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate\nactivities, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network partners, customers of Google Cloud\nofferings, lessors, and service providers with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to hold certain parties\nharmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property\ninfringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which\nan indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification\nagreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification\nagreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, we have\na limited history of prior indemnification claims and the payments we have made under such agreements have not\nhad a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent\nthat valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or\nreasonably possible.\nLegal Matters\nAntitrust Investigations\nOn November 30, 2010, the EC's Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various\nantitrust-related complaints against us.\nOn June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display\nand ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a\n\u20ac2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision to the\nGeneral Court, and on September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into\ncompliance with the EC's decision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2017.\nOn November 10, 2021, the General Court rejected our appeal, and we subsequently filed an appeal with the\nEuropean Court of Justice on January 20, 2022.\nOn July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google\u2019s Android-related distribution\nagreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a \u20ac4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30,\n2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision,\nand on October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution practices. On September\n14, 2022, the General Court rejected our appeal on three claims, accepted our appeal on one claim, and reduced\nthe fine to \u20ac4.1 billion. We are preparing to appeal to the European Court of Justice. In the second quarter of 2018,\nwe recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in the third quarter of 2022.\nOn March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that\nGoogle had with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a fine\nof \u20ac1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners'\nagreements, which we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed the EC decision, which\nremains pending. We recognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019.\nWhile each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities\non our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines.\nFrom time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on various competition\nmatters by regulatory authorities in the United States (U.S.), Europe, and other jurisdictions globally. For example:\n\u2022 In August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)\nrequesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our\nbusiness. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit on October 20, 2020 alleging\nthat Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising. Further, in June 2022,\nthe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the United Kingdom's Competition and\nMarkets Authority (CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\n\u2022 On December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state\n27",

The DOJ's investigation of similar issues remains\nongoing.

In May 2022, the EC and the CMA\neach opened a formal investigation into Google Play\u2019s business practices. Korean regulators are\ninvestigating Google Play's billing practices, most recently opening a formal review in May 2022 of Google's\ncompliance with the new app store billing regulations.\nWe believe these complaints are without merit and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue to cooperate\nwith federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights.

In\naddition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a\nresult of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\nOther\nWe are also regularly subject to claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings,\nand consent decrees involving competition, intellectual property, privacy and cybersecurity, tax and related\ncompliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services\noffered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters.\nFor example, we currently have a number of privacy investigations and suits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. Such\nclaims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent decrees could result in\nsubstantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing auditing and monitoring obligations, changes to our\nproducts and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or\nother adverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating\nresults.\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia.

We record a\nliability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably\nestimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we\ndisclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount\nof liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and\nmake adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being\nand the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters.\nWith respect to our outstanding matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range\nof reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of such\nmatters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.\n28",

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFor a description of our material pending legal proceedings, see Note 9 \u201cContingencies - Legal Matters\u201d of the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which\nis incorporated herein by reference.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described in\nPart I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of\nour stock. Below are material changes to our risk factors since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021.\nA variety of new and existing laws and/or interpretations could harm our business.\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters.\nNew laws and regulations, or new interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a manner\ninconsistent with our practices, have made, and may continue to make, our products and services less useful, limit\nour ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products and services in certain jurisdictions, require us\nto incur substantial costs, expose us to civil or criminal liability, or cause us to change our business practices. These\nlaws and regulations are evolving and involve matters central to our business, including, among others:\n\u2022 Laws and regulations around the world focused on large technology platforms, including the Digital Markets\nAct in the European Union and proposed antitrust legislation on self-preferencing and mergers and\nacquisitions in the U.S., which may limit certain business practices, and in some cases, create the risk of\nsignificant penalties.\n\u2022 Privacy laws, such as the GDPR, CCPA, CPRA, Virginia CDPA, and ColoPA (as defined and discussed\nfurther below).\n\u2022 Data protection laws passed by many states within the U.S. and by certain countries regarding notification\nto data subjects and/or regulators when there is a security breach of personal data.\n\u2022 Consumer protection laws, including EU\u2019s New Deal for Consumers, which could result in monetary\npenalties and create a range of new compliance obligations.\n\u2022 New laws further restricting the collection, processing and/or sharing of advertising-related data. Copyright\nor similar laws around the world, including the EU Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market\n(EUCD) and EU member state transpositions. These and similar laws that have been adopted or proposed\nintroduce new licensing regimes that could affect our ability to operate. The EUCD and similar laws could\nalso increase the liability of some content-sharing services with respect to content uploaded by their users.\nSome of these laws, as well as follow-on administrative or judicial actions, have also created or may create\na new property right in news publications that limits the ability of some online services to link to, interact\nwith, or present such content. They may also require individual or collective compensation negotiations with\nnews agencies and publishers for the use of such content, which may result in payment obligations that\nsignificantly exceed the value that such content provides to Google and its users, potentially harming our\nservices, commercial operations, and business results.\n\u2022 Data localization laws, which generally mandate that certain types of data collected in a particular country\nbe stored and/or processed within that country.\n\u2022 Various U.S. and international laws that govern the distribution of certain materials to children and regulate\nthe ability of online services to collect information from minors, including the Children\u2019s Online Privacy\nProtection Act of 1998 and the United Kingdom\u2019s Age-Appropriate Design Code.\n\u2022 Various laws with regard to content moderation and removal, and related disclosure obligations, such as\nGermany's Network Enforcement Act, the European Union's Digital Services Act, Florida's Senate Bill 7072\nand Texas' House Bill 20, which may affect our businesses and operations and may subject us to significant\nlitigation, damage claims, and fines if they are interpreted and applied in a manner inconsistent with our\npractices and policies, or if we remove or promote (or fail to remove or promote) content in ways\ninconsistent with those laws. Other countries, including Singapore, Australia, and the United Kingdom, have\nimplemented or are considering similar legislation imposing penalties for failure to remove certain types of\ncontent.\n49",

Any legislation or court\nrulings affecting these safe harbors may adversely affect us and may impose significant operational\nchallenges. There are legislative proposals and pending litigation in both the U.S. (such as Gonzalez v.\nGoogle) and EU that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for websites and online platforms.\n\u2022 Court decisions such as the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on May 13,\n2014 on the \u2018right to be forgotten,\u2019 which allows individuals to demand that Google remove search results\nabout them in certain instances, may limit the content we can show to our users and impose significant\noperational burdens.\nThe introduction of new businesses, products, services, and technologies, our activities in certain jurisdictions,\nor other actions we take have subjected us, and will likely continue to subject us, to additional laws and regulations.\nOur investment in a variety of new fields, such as healthcare and payment services, has expanded, and will\ncontinue to expand, the scope of regulations that apply to our business. The costs of compliance with these laws\nand regulations are high and are likely to increase in the future.

The trial commenced on September 12, 2023, and we expect a decision in 2024.\nFurther, in June 2022, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the United\nKingdom's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution\npractices.\n\u2022 On December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state\ndeceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology. Additionally, on January 24, 2023, the DOJ, along\nwith a number of state Attorneys General, filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for the\nEastern District of Virginia alleging that Google\u2019s digital advertising technology products violate U.S.\nantitrust laws, and on April 17, 2023, a number of additional state Attorneys General joined the complaint.\nThe EC, the CMA, and the ACCC each opened a formal investigation into Google's advertising technology\n27",

On June 14, 2023,\nthe EC issued a Statement of Objections (SO) informing Google of its preliminary view that Google violated\nEuropean antitrust laws relating to its advertising technology. We will respond to the SO by December 31,\n2023.\n\u2022 On July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court\nfor the Northern District of California, alleging that Google\u2019s operation of Android and Google Play violated\nU.S. antitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In September 2023, we reached a\nsettlement in principle with 50 state Attorneys General and three territories. The U.S. District Court\nsubsequently vacated the trial date with the states, and any final approval of the settlement is expected to\noccur in 2024. In May 2022, the EC and the CMA each opened investigations into Google Play\u2019s business\npractices. Korean regulators are investigating Google Play's billing practices, including a formal review in\nMay 2022 of Google's compliance with the new app store billing regulations. On October 6, 2023, the Korea\nCommunications Commission issued a preliminary decision that we are not in full compliance with the new\nregulations. We intend to respond in November 2023.\nWe believe these complaints are without merit and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue to cooperate\nwith federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in\nthese lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or\norders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have\nto change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss\nof revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has\nincreasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC\naction can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important\nmarket, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing\nmany important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against\ncertain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such\nclaims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In\naddition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a\nresult of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\nOther\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent\norders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and\nemployment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or\npublishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, we currently\nhave a number of privacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. We also periodically have\ndata incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. Such claims, lawsuits, regulatory and\ngovernment investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders could result in substantial fines and penalties,\ninjunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to\nour business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of\nwhich could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, civil judgments that include compounding\npenalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including\nthose of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.\nNon-Income Taxes\nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters.\nThe subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied\nto the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We\naccrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax\nauthorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and\nthe loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity\n28",

The EC decision\nimposed a \u20ac2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine. We appealed the EC decision and\nimplemented product changes to bring shopping ads into compliance with the EC's decision. On September\n10, 2024, the European Court of Justice rejected our appeal and upheld the \u20ac2.4 billion fine imposed in\n2017. In the third quarter of 2024, we made a cash payment of $3.0 billion for the 2017 shopping fine.\n\u2022 On July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google\u2019s Android-related\ndistribution agreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a \u20ac4.3 billion ($5.1\nbillion as of June 30, 2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018,\nwe appealed the EC decision, and on October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android\ndistribution practices. On September 14, 2022, the General Court reduced the fine from \u20ac4.3 billion to\n\u20ac4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice. In 2018, we recognized a\ncharge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in 2022.\n\u2022 On March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that\nGoogle had with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision\nimposed a fine of \u20ac1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for\nSearch partners' agreements, which we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed\nthe EC decision. We recognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019. On\nSeptember 18, 2024, the European Union\u2019s (EU) General Court overturned the EC decision and annulled\nthe \u20ac1.5 billion fine. The EC has until November 28, 2024 to appeal the decision.\nIn addition, on July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Northern District of California, alleging that Google\u2019s operation of Android and Google Play violated\nU.S. antitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In September 2023, we reached a settlement\nin principle with 50 state Attorneys General and three territories. The U.S. District Court subsequently vacated the\ntrial date with the states, and we expect any final approval of the settlement would come in 2024. In May 2024, we\nfunded the settlement amount to an escrow agent.\nIn December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict in a similar lawsuit in Epic Games v. Google. The jury\nfound that Google violated antitrust laws related to Google Play's business. Epic did not seek monetary damages.\nThe presiding judge issued a remedies decision on October 7, 2024, ordering a variety of alterations to our business\nmodels and operations and contractual agreements for Android and Google Play. We are appealing and have filed a\nmotion to pause the implementation of some of the remedies pending the appeal. The trial court judge has\ntemporarily paused the implementation of the remedies while the Court of Appeals considers our request to pause\nimplementation of the remedies pending the duration of the appeal.\nFrom time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on various competition\nmatters by regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally.
