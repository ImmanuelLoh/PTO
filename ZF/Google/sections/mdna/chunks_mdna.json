The growth in YouTube services was primarily due to an\nincrease in paid subscribers.\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues increased $1.0 billion from 2021 to 2022 primarily driven\nby growth in subscription and device revenues, partially offset by a decrease in platform revenues. The growth in\nsubscriptions was largely for YouTube services, primarily due to an increase in paid subscribers. The growth in device\nrevenues was primarily driven by increased sales of Pixel devices. The decrease in platform revenues was primarily\ndue to Google Play, driven by the fee structure changes we announced in 2021 as well as a decrease in buyer\nspending. Additionally, the overall increase in Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues was adversely\naffected by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates.\nGoogle Cloud\nGoogle Cloud revenues increased $6.8 billion from 2022 to 2023. Growth was primarily driven by Google Cloud\nPlatform followed by Google Workspace offerings.

Additionally, a decrease in the 2024 U.S. federal Foreign Derived Intangible Income tax deduction\ncontributed to an increase in the effective tax rate.

In Google Cloud, we generate cash\nthrough consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, applications, and other cloud services.\nOur primary uses of cash from operating activities include payments to distribution and Google Network partners,\nto employees for compensation, and to content providers. Other uses of cash from operating activities include\npayments to suppliers for devices, to tax authorities for income taxes, and other general corporate expenditures.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased from 2023 to 2024 due to an increase in cash received from\ncustomers, partially offset by an increase in cash payments for cost of revenues and operating expenses.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nCash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of investments in marketable and\nnon-marketable securities.

Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of stock,\nnet payments related to stock-based award activities, payment of dividends, and repayments of debt.\nNet cash used in financing activities increased from 2023 to 2024 due to dividend payments and net payments\nrelated to stock-based award activities, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from issuance of debt, net of\nrepayments.\n41.",

The margins from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional\ndesktop search. Additionally, as the market for a particular device type or modality matures, our advertising revenues\nmay be affected. For example, growth in the global smartphone market has slowed due to various factors, including\nincreased market saturation in developed countries, which can affect our mobile advertising revenues.\nWe expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our revenues grow\nand TAC as a percentage of our advertising revenues (\"TAC rate\") to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic\nmix; partner mix; partner agreement terms; the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points; product\nmix; the relative revenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels; and revenue share terms.\nWe expect these trends to continue to affect our revenues and put pressure on our margins.\n\u2022 As online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings, which may affect our\nmonetization.\nAs interactions between users and advertisers change, and as online user behavior evolves, we continue to\nexpand our product offerings to serve these changing needs, which may affect our monetization. For example,\nrevenues from ads on YouTube and Google Play monetize at a lower rate than our traditional search ads.
